description: Record the proof clip a T2+ change needs — one uncut, real-speed Playwright video of the changed user journey on a local fake-mind world, with a scrub bar and timecode burned in, desktop and (when layout changed) phone — then attach it to the pull request without committing video into the repo. Use when a change is tier T2 or higher, when a PR or issue asks for a clip, when the finish skill reaches its proof step, or when reproducing a bug on camera for triage.

# proof — an uncut clip of the changed journey

A reviewer should be able to watch what a user would see, at normal speed, start to finish. The clip is the
evidence; a screenshot, a contact sheet or a sped-up recording is not.

Source of truth for what a tier needs: `docs/process/PROOF-POLICY.yml` (T0 nothing; T1 focused tests + typecheck;
T2 adds one clip of the changed journey, desktop, plus phone if layout changed, on a fake-mind world; T3/T4 add more).
Get the tier of the current diff with `node tools/proof/tier.mjs --base origin/main`.

## Rules
- **Uncut and real speed.** One browser context, one take. Never trim, splice, speed up or slow down. If the journey
  is longer than the policy's `max_seconds`, record a shorter journey that still shows the change, not a faster one.
- **Real input.** Drive with `page.mouse`, `page.keyboard`, `page.touchscreen` or locator clicks, the way a user
  would. Do not call app internals from `page.evaluate` to make things happen on camera.
- **Fake minds, isolated data.** Local worlds only, `BRAIN_MODE=fake`, a fresh data dir. Never record against a
  production world unless the maintainer asks, and never with a signed-in personal browser profile.
- **Never commit video** (or frames) into the repo. Work under `.e2e/` (gitignored).
- The clip must show the change. Watch it (or at least extract frames, below) before you attach it.

## 1. Boot a fake-mind world

Needs a built web client (`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm --filter @sim/web build`; skip if
`apps/web/dist/index.html` exists and is current for your change). In a fresh clone the build's prebuild check fails
until the web media are in place: `node tools/assets/pull.mjs --only 'apps/web/**'` (a few files) is enough for it.

```bash
node tools/god-skill/dev-world.mjs proof 4710 --genesis worlds/templates/hello-hamlet.json --fresh --data .local/proof
# prints http://127.0.0.1:4710/w/proof?dev=1 (pid N, log .lane/proof.log); the server keeps running detached
```

The homepage (world list, New world) is served by the world launcher, not by a single world. For a journey that
starts there, run a launcher (its worlds always get fake minds) and make a world for the list through its API:

```bash
node tools/world-launcher/launcher.mjs --port 4720 --range 4721-4723 --data "$PWD/.local/proof-launcher" --eager 0 &
curl -s -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' -H 'authorization: Bearer dev:proof' \
  -d '{"name":"Proof Garden","template":"hello-hamlet"}' http://127.0.0.1:4720/__sim/worlds
# record against http://127.0.0.1:4720/ ; stop the launcher by its pid (it stops its worlds)
```

Pick the template that contains the changed surface (`worlds/templates/`: hello-hamlet is small and fast; eden-2026,
mars-two and others are larger). Use a free port; `E2E.md` lists ports reserved for other harnesses. Stop the server
with `kill <pid>` when done.

## 2. Write the steps

Copy `.claude/skills/proof/steps.example.mjs` to `.e2e/proof/<slug>/steps.mjs` and script the changed journey:
arrive, do the thing, show the result. `mark('label')` stamps a chapter time into the sidecar so the PR can say
"the panel opens at 0:07". Keep it to the journey the change affects.

## 3. Record

```bash
node .claude/skills/proof/record.mjs --url 'http://127.0.0.1:4710/w/proof?dev=1' \
  --steps .e2e/proof/<slug>/steps.mjs --out .e2e/proof/<slug>/desktop.mp4 --viewport desktop
# layout or touch changed? also:
node .claude/skills/proof/record.mjs --url '...' --steps .e2e/proof/<slug>/steps.mjs \
  --out .e2e/proof/<slug>/phone.mp4 --viewport phone
```

- Browsers: uses `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH`, else `/opt/pw-browsers` when present. If Chromium is missing:
  `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH="$PWD/.e2e/browsers" pnpm --filter mars-campus-viewer exec playwright install chromium`.
- Playwright is resolved the same way the playtest harness does (`tools/playtest/lib/platform.mjs`: a global
  `playwright`, else `@playwright/test` from `mars/viewer`). No GPU is needed; WebGL runs on SwiftShader.
- `--max-seconds` defaults to the policy's `max_seconds`. Exit 3 means the journey ran past it: shorten it.
- With ffmpeg: an mp4 with a progress bar along the bottom and a `hh:mm:ss / total` timecode (the timecode needs an
  ffmpeg built with drawtext; the sidecar's `timecode` says whether it is there). Without ffmpeg: the raw `.webm`;
  say so in the PR (players still show their own scrub bar).
- Each clip gets a `<clip>.json` sidecar: url, viewport, duration, marks, console errors, commit and dirty flag.
  Console errors in the sidecar are findings: explain or fix them.

The run takes well under the 10-minute foreground limit. For several clips in one go, run them in the background
(`nohup setsid node ... > .e2e/proof/<slug>/rec.log 2>&1 &`) and poll the log.

## 4. Check it yourself

```bash
for t in 1 4 8; do ffmpeg -loglevel error -y -ss $t -i .e2e/proof/<slug>/desktop.mp4 -frames:v 1 .e2e/proof/<slug>/t$t.png; done
```

Look at the frames (Read the PNGs). The changed state must be visible, the world must have loaded (not a blank or
loading canvas), and nothing in frame should be private. If it does not show the change, fix the steps and record a
new take; do not attach a clip that does not prove the claim.

## 5. Attach it to the PR (never commit it)

```bash
node tools/proof/upload.mjs --pr $N --proof .e2e/journal/$ISSUE/proof.json .e2e/proof/$SLUG/desktop.mp4 .e2e/proof/$SLUG/phone.mp4
```

- The default target is the repo's `proofs` prerelease (it is created on first use). Assets are named
  `pr-<n>.<file>`, and a re-take gets `-2`, `-3`, so earlier takes, including failed ones, stay linkable.
  `SIM_PROOF_UPLOAD_URL` (+ `SIM_PROOF_UPLOAD_TOKEN`) switches to another endpoint, such as a CDN.
- With `--proof`, the links are written into proof.json `media[]`, and proof.json is uploaded last. Paste its link
  and the clip links into the PR's Proof section. The `journal` skill covers proof.json.
- **Inline preview.** GitHub serves release assets as downloads, so an mp4 link never plays in the PR. For each
  video, `upload.mjs` makes a small animated GIF with ffmpeg (`<clip>.preview.gif`: the first 6 s at real speed, at
  most 5 MB), uploads it beside the clip, records it as `media[].preview` and prints a line like
  `[![desktop.mp4](…pr-412.desktop.preview.gif)](…pr-412.desktop.mp4)`. Paste that line: the preview plays in the
  PR and clicking it opens the full clip. When the change shows later in the clip, pick the window with
  `--preview-start <s>` (and `--preview-seconds <s>`). The preview is a pointer, not the proof: the uncut mp4 is.
- **Exit 3: the upload is blocked** (no `gh`, not signed in, no permission, or no network, as in many cloud
  sessions). Tell the user which clips are waiting and where. Post a PR comment with each clip's duration,
  viewport, sidecar summary (marks, console errors, commit), and the exact `record.mjs` command and steps file, so
  anyone can re-record it. Mark the proof "pending upload" in the PR body. Never paste video as base64, never
  commit it, and never push it to another branch.

`gh pr` may not work in cloud sessions; comment with
`gh api repos/$REPO/issues/$N/comments -F body=@.e2e/proof/$SLUG/comment.md`.

## What to write next to the clip
One line per clip: what journey, which world template, viewport, duration, commit, and the moment the change is
visible ("0:07 the seat highlights and the Soul sits"). Plus any console errors and why they are acceptable.
