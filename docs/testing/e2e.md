# Browser end-to-end checks

Markdown scenarios in `e2e/scenarios/` drive the app in headless Chromium from an explicit browser cache, never a
signed-in browser profile. `e2e/config.mjs` holds the paths, the client fixture's reserved ports and the attempt cap.

Install Chromium into the workspace cache first:

```sh
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH="$PWD/.e2e/browsers" pnpm --filter mars-campus-viewer exec playwright install chromium
```

## Local smoke

`local-smoke.md` is the quick proof that the app works: one command boots an isolated instance on a free port, opens
the world list and one world, and checks that a person is drawn with no console errors and no failed requests. Any
agent, laptop, cloud session or CI runner can run it; it takes about 30 seconds after the builds.

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm assets:pull --set web,runtime
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH="$PWD/.e2e/browsers" pnpm --filter mars-campus-viewer exec playwright install chromium
node e2e/local-smoke.mjs --build                 # any free port; or --port 9950, or E2E_PORT=9950
node e2e/local-smoke.mjs --port 9950 --clip      # also one uncut, real-speed clip of the whole run
```

- **Isolated.** It runs the world launcher (`tools/world-launcher/launcher.mjs`) on the port and its one world on the
  next two ports, with fake minds, dev sign-in and a data dir under the run directory. It creates a `hello-hamlet`
  world as `dev:smoke` and one Soul, Ada. It refuses ports reserved in `e2e/config.mjs`, and ports in use.
- **Checks**, step by step: the launcher answers healthy; the world list shows the world's card; clicking it opens
  the world, whose canvas has a live WebGL context and draws Ada's figure (a skinned person rig) with no "could not be
  prepared" notice; Explore → "Ada" → Enter follows her into the frame. Each step fails on any console error, page
  error, failed request or HTTP error. Requests the page cancels itself (`net::ERR_ABORTED`, an AbortController
  superseding a fetch) are listed as `cancelledRequests` and don't fail it.
- **Output** in `.local/e2e/<UTC timestamp>/` (`--out` to choose): `summary.json` (status, commit, port, PIDs, timings,
  every assertion, every error and failed request, teardown), `shots/1-world-list.png`, `2-world.png`,
  `3-person.png`, `launcher.log`, and with `--clip` `clip.mp4` (`clip.webm` without ffmpeg).
- **Teardown** always: it closes the browser and stops the launcher and its world by their exact PIDs, and records
  in the summary that both are gone. The data dir is removed after a pass (`--keep-data` keeps it).
- **Exit** 0 pass, 1 a check failed, 2 a precondition is missing: the message names the command that fixes it
  (`--build` builds the web app and the viewer's static build when they are missing).
- **People need the viewer's static build.** The character models (`/modular`) come from
  `pnpm build:viewer` (issue #395). Without it the world never draws Ada and the run
  fails with the 404s in the summary.
- CI runs it on PRs that touch `apps/web`, `apps/server` or `e2e` (the `smoke` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
- Use it as a PR's proof: upload `summary.json` and the screenshots (and the clip) with `node tools/proof/upload.mjs`.
  It is a scripted e2e, so it proves the page loads and draws; a T2 change still needs a clip of its own journey
  (the `proof` skill).

## Client fixture scenarios (`e2e/scenarios/client-fixture-arrival.md`)

Scenarios are Markdown files with front matter (`id`, `tier`, `fixture`, `critical_path`) and numbered steps of
actions plus `expect`, `expect-url`, `expect-console` and `screenshot` lines. An agent runs them with the `e2e` repo
skill and writes screenshots, page text and a machine-readable summary under `.e2e/runs/` (gitignored); a scenario
with a `runner` in its front matter runs as that command instead.

`client-fixture-arrival.md` covers arrival, camera and selection, and leaving and re-entering an isolated world:

- The fixture is a private, test-flagged world started from a tracked genesis with fake minds, served on
  loopback port 7830. Read-only bundle proxies run on 7834 (candidate) and 7835 (control). Chrome is driven over
  CDP on 7838 with a scratch profile, and an optional phone observer uses 7839.
- Arrival is complete when the entity layer is active, the asset queue is empty, every selected LOD asset has
  loaded and a hardware WebGL renderer is in use.
- The scenario leaves through the fixture's `/healthz` page and checks that re-entry creates a new document with
  exactly one world canvas. This proves full-document navigation only, not same-document renderer cleanup.

Rules for fixture runs:

- Whoever boots the fixture records its process IDs and stops only those processes. Never kill a process just
  because it holds a port, and never point scenarios at production worlds or production data.
- Build the browser bundle under test from a committed tree and record its path and hash with the fixture.
- Re-run a passing scenario only after a source change. Performance A/B samples are planned measurements
  (see [the speed tools](../../tools/speed/README.md)), not repeated smoke attempts.

The release-time real-Chrome walks (V7) are separate; see [remote gate](remote-gate.md).

## God modal Undo/Redo observation (E1)

E1 captures the accepted owner-button ACK sequence and two first snapshot reads before taking screenshots. A unique
query must be a launcher cache MISS with public `seq >= ACK.seq` and the exact original bench removed/restored. That
single immediate check is never retried into a pass. Separately, the unchanged public URL must converge to the same
sequence/state within 3000ms of the ACK: the documented hot C3 cache TTL is 2000ms, with 1000ms for request/scheduling.
The first same-URL response, cache headers and monotonic timestamps remain in the report, including stale hits.
Rejected ACKs, missing/stale sequences, replacement identities, late convergence and page errors fail. This observes
the existing cache policy; it changes neither production caching nor Undo/Redo admission. Earlier release receipts
retain their original verdicts. Focused regression: `node --test tools/world-launcher/edit-observation.test.mjs`.
