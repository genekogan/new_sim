# Playtests

`tools/playtest/` plays a Sim world the way real people do. Coding agents act as the Souls' owners ("seats"), and
model personas decide what each owner says and when. A browser observer records what a visitor would see, and the
review step scores every request against world truth. Use it to measure the Soul experience before and after a
change. It is never part of CI.

The method (what to measure, how to compare arms) is in [playtest method](../process/playtest-method.md). Running a
replay set on a cloud machine is in [cloud playtests](playtests-cloud.md). Live multi-Soul scenes directed from a
chat session are in [swarm director](swarm-director.md).

```

Everything prints JSON on stdout and logs to stderr. `--server-root` is the Sim checkout whose server the dev worlds
run from (it needs a built `apps/web/dist`). Pass it explicitly, and pass `--out` or `--runs-root` for where runs go.

## A run

`run` executes eight steps. Each writes `receipts/<n>-<step>.json`. A failed step stops the run and leaves
everything in place, and `--from <step>` resumes.

| Step | Does | Writes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| preflight | server root, web build, CLI, Playwright, model CLIs, machine gate, plan usage | `preflight.json` |
| provision | starts a local dev world from the scenario's genesis (dev auth, fake native minds) | `world.json` |
| seats | one folder per seat; the seat agent onboards from the world's served instructions, as a friend's agent would | `seats/<id>/seat.json` |
| play | the director runs personas or a script against the seats; the observer samples world truth and screenshots | `personas/`, `evidence/`, `shots/`, transcripts |
| close | stops seats; stops the world unless `--keep-world` | `close.json` |
| review | oracles, reviewer scores, issues, feature requests, emergence | `oracles.jsonl`, `ledger.tsv`, `issues.*`, `feature-requests.*`, `emergence.json` |
| develop | a draft spec per issue and feature request | `specs/<id>.md` |
| report | report, player's-eye journal, metrics, replay record | `REPORT.md`, `journal.md`, `metrics.json`, `replay.json` |

### Seats

A seat is a headless coding agent with its own folder and one session for the whole run. Two adapters exist:
`claude-headless` (`claude -p`, no MCP, a short allowlist of relative-path tools) and `codex-headless`
(`codex exec`). The harness writes only an identity seed into the folder before onboarding. It never reads the seat's
credentials afterwards. Seats are told to run one command per tool call, from the seat folder, with relative paths
(`node eden.mjs ...`), and no `cd` or `&&` chains. Between turns a Claude seat keeps `node eden.mjs listen` running,
and when it exits with messages the harness wakes the seat with that output, as Claude Code does for a finished
background task. Codex seats wake only when `wake: true`. An optional god seat sets itself up from the world's
served god skill.

### Personas

`personas/*.md` are character sheets: newcomer, casual, social, spectator, storyteller, boundary, pinkteam, expert,
and the creators first-timer, tinkerer, storyteller-god and pinkteam-god. A sheet describes who the player is, their
patience, attention and channel mix, how they rate, and the JSON they answer with. It never mentions Sim internals.
A persona keeps one model session per run and sees only what a player sees: a screenshot, the legible page text, the
chat as a terminal renders it, and the card. It answers with what to say (chat or card), how long to wait, a rating,
desires and complaints. Seats are scheduled from separate seeded RNGs, and no persona sees another seat's information.

### Observer and evidence

The observer polls the public and owner routes for each Soul (place, posture, activity, receipts) and keeps follow
and wide browser cameras open. Each request gets `evidence/<requestId>.json`: what was sent, the ack and result,
body samples, receipts, screenshots, linked chat turns and server errors, up to its budget cutoff. Facts observed
after the cutoff are diagnostic only.

### Review

- **Oracles** (`review/oracles.mjs`) are code-only checks that return pass, fail or unknown: ack latency, result sent,
  listening, arrival, posture, duration held, inside-solid, no-progress, oscillation, stuck receipt, truthfulness,
  vocabulary, duplicate acts, server errors and first body change. A scripted request may carry an `expect` block (a
  target from the genesis, words the answer must use, a facing) scored by `review/expect-oracles.mjs`.
- **Reviewer** (`review/reviewer.mjs`) scores each request H (hit), P (partial), M (honest miss) or W (wrong) using
  [`review/RUBRIC.md`](../../tools/playtest/review/RUBRIC.md). It writes issues in player terms only; causes, code
  areas and fixes are stripped. With `review.mode: "deterministic"` no model scores are made and only oracles count.
- **Developer** (`review/developer.mjs`) reads the server source (read-only tools) and writes a spec per issue marked
  `DRAFT — NOT IMPLEMENTED`. It never edits files.

## Scenarios

`scenarios/*.json` (validated by `scenarios/lib/validate.mjs`):

```json
{
  "name": "newcomer-rich-1", "version": 1, "seed": 1,
  "world": { "kind": "dev", "genesis": "worlds/templates/eden-2026.json", "slug": "pt-eden-a", "port": 4990 },
  "durationSec": 600,
  "seats": [{ "id": "pip", "adapter": "claude-headless", "model": "haiku", "effort": "medium",
              "persona": "newcomer", "personaModel": "opus", "startOffsetSec": 0, "soulName": "Pip",
              "channelMix": { "chat": 0.3, "card": 0.7 } }],
  "god": null,
  "director": { "mode": "persona", "requestsTarget": 8, "glanceSec": [10, 30] },
  "observer": { "sampleSec": 5, "cameras": ["follow", "wide"], "viewport": [1280, 800], "dpr": 1 },
  "review": { "reviewerModel": "opus", "developerModel": "opus", "rubric": "accept3" },
  "rails": { "maxTurnsPerRequest": 6, "maxTurnWallSec": 240, "quotaStopPct": 90 }
}
```

- `world.kind` must be `dev`. Every seat needs an `id`, an `adapter`, a `soulName` and (for Claude) a `model`.
- `director.mode` is `persona` (every seat needs a persona) or `scripted`, with
  `script: [{ "seat", "atSec", "channel": "chat"|"card", "text", "budgetSec", "expect"? }]`. A seat's scripted
  requests must not overlap their budgets.
- **Batteries** are scripted scenarios that send the same basic requests to every seat and are scored by oracles
  (`basics-walk-act-*.json`). `scenarios/unified/` holds frozen journey fixtures with exact physical targets; see its
  README.

## Frozen sets and scorecards

`review/scorecard.mjs` names a frozen set of runs (batteries and persona runs). `replay-set` replays each one as a
scripted replay that sends the original requests on the original channels, `--repeats` times (default two), one after
another. It writes `SCORECARD.md` and `replay-set.json`. The scorecard reports the measures with their thresholds
against a baseline, plus a no-new-bugs verdict. W counts and physical-oracle failures must not rise on any frozen run,
and H must not fall on any battery seat. A change counts only if every repeat shows it, and repeats that disagree are
reported as unsure. `--score-only` rescores existing repeats, and `--dry-run` prints the plan.

`freeze-bundle` writes `frozen/frozen.json`: each frozen run's replay scenario and baseline measures, without
screenshots or transcripts. Machines without the original run folders can then run the set.

## Measuring well

- **Use a quiet machine.** The machine gate requires a 1-minute load under 10 and at least 6 GB of reclaimable memory.
  A loaded machine produces slow client calls and false failures. `replay-set` waits for the gate (`--gate-wait-min`,
  default 30) and stops if it never clears. `--force-machine` continues and records the breach.
- **Two repeats per arm.** Compare arms only on like-for-like repeats (scripted replay against scripted replay),
  and fix acceptance bars and budgets before the baseline is measured.
- Preflight checks Claude plan usage through the script named by `PLAYTEST_USAGE_PY`. If that script is absent the
  check is skipped.

## Request ceilings on local test worlds

Callers launch test worlds exactly as `arena/provision.mjs` `startWorld` does: `node apps/server/src/main.ts` directly
on `127.0.0.1:<port>` with the release defaults. Set no load variables (`SIM_ADMISSION`, `SIM_FLOOD`, `SIM_LOAD_*`,
`SIM_WAKING_LIMIT`). The world then admits like production, so a test world measures what the live one does
([load contract](../architecture/load.md) §2b). What applies there:

- **No per-address limit.** The world's flood guard (`apps/server/src/flood.ts`) and the launcher's address ceilings
  (`tools/world-launcher/flood.mjs` `SOUL_CEILINGS.ipPer10s/ipConcurrent/ipListen`) both key on `x-forwarded-for`, which
  only the reverse proxy sets. A caller on 127.0.0.1 is never limited by address.
- **No listener caps.** `soulListen` / `accountListen` / `ipListen` are launcher ceilings. A world started directly has
  none. Long-polls and streams (`/v1/edge/wait`, `/v1/edge/inbox/listen`, `/v1/edge/events`) are C0 in the world and are
  never queued or refused.
- **In-world admission stays on.** It allows one heavy (C1/C2) request in flight per Soul token. A second one at once
  gets `429 soul.busy` with Retry-After 1. Twenty such overlaps in a minute, or the CPU budget overrun three times, give
  that Soul 60 s of `soul.slow-down`, its acts included. A driver must therefore keep one heavy request in flight per
  Soul. Harness observation goes through the owner and public routes (`arena/owner.mjs`), which the admission does not
  count.
- Measured (release 402) on a copy of the Eden 2026 world with 6 Souls: each Soul held an SSE events stream, a wait
  long-poll and an inbox listen (18 held in all) and ran sequential here/observe/capabilities reads, about 1.5 a second
  per Soul, for 60 s, alongside the public Soul reads. All 538 heavy reads and all held requests were answered 200. Two
  concurrent `here` reads per Soul gave 5 `soul.busy` out of 12.
- **Only when a test world runs behind the launcher**, with Souls that share one owner account, raise that world's
  account ceilings, never the address ones: the registry `limits` in worlds.json, or
  `op.mjs set-limits --port <launcher port> --slug <slug> --limits '{"accountListen":24,"accountHeavyPerMin":600,"worldBudgetRps":30}'`.
  At 3 held per Soul plus a thin `listen`, five Souls on one account pass `accountListen` 12. The default 120 heavy a
  minute per account is about 24 per Soul.
- A `429 client.rate` / `soul.busy` / `account.rate` from our own driver means a ceiling is working, not a server bug.
  Fix the driver.

## Tests

Each module has `node --test` files on recorded fixtures (no world, no model):

```sh
node --test tools/playtest/**/*.test.mjs
```

`arena/smoke.mjs` and `observer/smoke.mjs` boot a real dev world and are run by hand.
