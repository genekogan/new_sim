# The Mars engine

`mars/` is a vendored, hard-forked world engine: a deterministic world and activity runtime in pure TypeScript
(`mars/viewer/engine/`), a three.js viewer and Lab (`mars/viewer/app/`), and a Cloudflare Worker host
(`mars/viewer/simulation/`). It was built for a model of a desert campus and its buildings; in Sim it runs behind
the engine contract through `packages/engine-mars` (`ENGINE=mars`). See
[the engine contract](../architecture/engine-contract.md) for the mapping.

The long-term plan is to deprecate `mars/` and generalize its useful parts into Sim. These docs describe the
engine as it is, briefly; read the code for detail.

## Engine overview

- **Determinism.** Fixed tick `DT = 1/20 s` (`runtime/runtime.ts`); seeded sfc32 RNG whose state lives in
  `world.rng`; deterministic transcendentals in `core/math.ts` (`dsin`, `datan2`, …; host `Math.sin` and friends
  are banned by `engine/test/source-scan.test.ts`); no wall clock. `zod` is the only runtime dependency.
- **World state** is plain JSON (`world/types.ts`, schema `mars-world/1`): entities, regions, environment,
  inventory and RNG. `hashOf = sha256(stableStringify(x))`. `physicalView` drops labels, provenance, tick and
  environment, so plans bind to a `physicalHash` that camera or lighting edits cannot invalidate.
- **Runtime.** `submit(verb, params, { parent?, preempt? })` moves an action through
  requested → validated → reserved → executing → completed / failed / cancelled. Reservations (`actor:<id>`,
  `slot:<id>`, `entity:<id>`, …) are exclusive. Invariants run at the end of every tick and record named
  violations. `snapshot()` / `Runtime.restore()` resume a verified subset of verbs tick-exactly.
- **Verbs.** `ActionDef { verb, schema (zod), reservations, plan, start, step, cancel, … }`. One registry
  (`api/registry.ts`) generates the REST ops, MCP tools (`engine_<op>`) and browser schemas. `plan` is pure and is
  the feasibility check; refusals are `Diagnostic { code, message, subjects }` naming concrete objects.
- **Space.** `spatial/` rasterizes a `SpatialScene` (levels, surfaces, obstacles, links) into 0.1 m grids with exact
  EDT clearance; multi-level A* with stair links and corridor string-pulling. Construction bumps a navigation
  epoch and walkers replan.
- **History, plans and takes.** `WorldHistory` stores content-addressed checkpoints, protected canonical workspaces
  and forks (no merge). Sequence templates bind to a checkpoint as `BoundPlan`s; stale plans are refused with a
  diff. A take records quantized pose tracks and change events; renderers and cameras consume takes, never a live
  runtime.
- **Execution model of the original host.** "Submit a plan → simulate faster than real time in one request → store
  a take → viewers poll." Sim's shell supplies the 24/7 loop, event log, accounts and agents around it.
