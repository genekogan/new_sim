# Component and data-flow map

The actual things: the classes, concepts and contracts that make up a Sim world, and how data moves between them.
[architecture.md](../architecture.md) is the overview by component; this page is the map by *seam*, for reasoning about
contracts, performance and where a feature would plug in. Every claim below was read from the code at the paths given;
where the code and an older doc disagree, the code is quoted and the doc is named.

Solid edges are the contracts named in §10. The dotted edges are the two paths that are easy to misplace: model calls
never touch the engine (they end as logged events), and the engine's `ProgramEvent`s are what turn a Soul's act into
a receipt.

## 2. The world process

One world is one Node process, built in `apps/server/src/main.ts`: a `Db` on `$DATA_DIR/sim.db` (`main.ts:69`),
a `WorldHost` (`:98`), `Auth`, `Brain`, `Souls`, `Hub`, optional `IntentControlV2`, `EdgeLedger` (edge mode only,
`:149`), `GodMode` (`:153`), `GroundHost`, `EngineBridge`, and the Hono app from `http.ts`.

**Who owns what.** Three state owners share the process, and only `WorldHost` may change two of them:

| Owner | State | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `Engine` (physics, "depiction") | `WorldState` (entities, regions, env, RNG), running `ActionRecord`s, programs, takes | `packages/engine-contract/src/engine.ts:87`; Mars: `packages/engine-mars/src/engine.ts:193` |
| `KState` (meaning) | `things`, `links`, `vocab` (kinds, link kinds, cards, manners), `decks`, `nextId` | `packages/kernel/src/types.ts` |
| `WorldHost` (sequencer) | `minds: Map<soulId, Mind>` (intent, agenda, mood, `pending` card), `seq`, `clockRate`, `extra` (adopted rules/policies), the input queue, the batch ring | `apps/server/src/world.ts:126-176` |
| Server modules, outside the fold | god entity model (`world_entities_v1`, `world_defs_v1`), edge receipts, comms streams, accounts, Soul `now` lines | `god/store.ts:40-87`, `edge/ledger/ledger.ts:295`, `edge/comms/store.ts:10-26`, `accounts/store.ts`, `soul-now.ts` |

**The input queue.** `WorldHost.enqueue(kind, author, payload)` (`world.ts:658`) pushes a `Pending` onto a plain array
and returns a Promise that resolves with the logged event. Variants: `enqueueChecked` adds a synchronous
`AcceptanceGuard` (re-checked at drain time, never replayed), `enqueueObjectDecision` journals a private row in the same
SQLite transaction, `enqueueIntentDecision` previews program admission on a restored engine copy. The `EventKind` union
(`packages/protocol/src/index.ts:73`) has 29 kinds: `birth`, `intent`, `mandate`, `decision`, `edge-stop`,
`edge-relocate`, `edge-god-walkout`, `edge-attention`, `body-assignment-v1`, `world-edit`, `play`, `mint`, `deck`,
`scene`, `rules`, `admin`, `retire`, the `intent-*-v2`/`v1` family and the `station-*` family. Ordering is strictly FIFO
across all authors (`this.queue.splice(0)`); there is no per-Soul fairness, so one Soul's burst is logged ahead of
everyone else's inputs for that tick.

**One frame, in order** (`frame`, `pumpFrame`, `tickOnce`, `drainInputs`: `world.ts:432-612`):

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant T as setInterval(TICK_MS / pace)
  participant H as WorldHost
  participant DB as sim.db
  participant K as KState (fold.ts)
  participant E as Engine
  participant L as listeners (Brain, EdgeLedger, EngineBridge, Hub)
  T->>H: frame(): due = floor(carry); cap 40; dilate after 3 overruns
  loop one tick per setImmediate
    H->>H: drainInputs(): queue.splice(0)
    H->>DB: appendEvent(seq+1, tick, kind, author, payload)
    H->>K: apply(e) → foldEvent: applyAll(kernel changes)
    H->>E: perform(program) for decision; applyWorldEditV1 for world-edit
    H->>E: step() → {paths, changes, events, programs}
    H->>H: advanceLives(); sweep(kernel); afterPrograms(programs) → enqueue('play')
    H->>L: onRuntimeEvent, afterTick(tick)
    L-->>H: enqueue(...) for the next tick
    alt tick % 10 == 0
      H->>L: onBatch(Batch) → hub broadcast
    end
    alt tick % 100 == 0
      H->>L: onHeartbeat({viewHash, 8 keyframes})
    end
    alt tick - lastSnapshotTick >= SNAPSHOT_EVERY_TICKS
      H->>DB: schedulePeriodicSnapshot(): capture now, encode + write in 4 ms setImmediate slices
    end
  end
```

Constants: `TICK_MS = 50`, `BATCH_TICKS = 10`, `HEARTBEAT_TICKS = 100`, `RING_BATCHES = 600` (`world.ts:120-123`);
`SNAPSHOT_EVERY_TICKS` default 6,000 (`config.ts:61`); `pace` is 1 while watched, `SIM_UNWATCHED_PACE` (default 0.25)
otherwise (`attention.ts:16-19`), and pace is not logged. Overrun handling halves `clockRate` to no lower than
`baseRate/4` and logs a `rules` event `{clockRate, why:'dilation'}`; 200 calm frames double it back (`world.ts:449-452`).
A listener's `enqueue` during `afterTick` lands in the next tick, except under `durableClockV1` (Eden core worlds) where
`drainInputs()` runs a second time before the frontier is persisted (`world.ts:497`).

**Replay.** `fold.ts` is the single fold used live, at restart and in tests: `boot()` loads the latest row of `snapshots`
(engine runtime + minds + kernel + `extra`, `SnapshotBody`) and re-applies later `events` rows. `replayKernel` rebuilds
`KState` from the log alone with the world's *pinned* vocabulary (the first `rules` event carrying `vocabulary`), never
the code's current one (`fold.ts:20-33`). The engine replays because every body movement started from a logged
`decision` and continues deterministically inside `Engine.step()`.

**SQLite layout** (`migrations.ts`, plus module-owned tables): canonical `worlds`, `events (world_id, seq) PK`,
`snapshots (world_id, tick) PK` with `state_hash`/`physical_hash`, `souls`, `users`, `paid_costs`,
`clock_frontiers_v1`; god `world_meta_v1`, `world_defs_v1`, `world_entities_v1`, `world_edits_v1`, `god_tokens_v1`,
`god_builds_v1`; edge `edge_receipts_v1`, `edge_outcomes_v1`, `edge_comms_*` (stream, speech, conversations, turns,
objects, work), `edge_items_v1`, `edge_follows_v1`; takes `take_chunks`, `take_archives`; intents
`intent_requests_v2`, `intent_observations_v2`, `intent_arrivals_v1`. The shared `accounts.sqlite` (one per launcher
stage) holds only `provider_accounts_v1` (`account-registry.ts`).

## 3. The engine seam

`Engine` (`packages/engine-contract/src/engine.ts:87`) is what the host, brain and clients may ask of any engine:
`rulesVersion`, `dt`, `schema`, `runtime: RuntimeView`, `world: WorldState`, `describeVerbs()`, `stateHash()`,
`physicalHash()`, `step()` returning `{paths: PathCommit[]; changes: ChangeEvent[]; events: RuntimeEvent[]; programs:
ProgramEvent[]}`, `perform(Program): ProgramAdmission`, `stop`, `canPerform`, `programOf`, `snapshot`,
`spawnHuman`, `removeEntity`, `enumerateActivities`, `describeSurroundings`, `anchors`, `poseSampleOf`,
`currentPath`, plus about sixty optional `preview*V1` / `adopt*V1` hooks for logged transitions. `EngineFactory`
(`:218`) is `{rulesVersion, genesis(seed), create(world), restore(snap), canRestoreSnapshot?, canReplayHistory?,
validateHistoryHead?}`. `Runtime` (`runtime.ts`, `DT = 1/20` at line 8) steps live `ActionRecord`s in id order then
runs invariants; `ActionDef<Params, Program, Exec>` (`actions.ts`) has `plan`, `start → Exec`, `step(rt, exec, dt)`,
`cancel`, `serializeExec`/`restoreExec`: an `Exec` is in-flight state that must serialize at any tick.

**Determinism.** `hashOf = sha256(stableStringify(x))` (`hash.ts`); the RNG is sfc32 with its state in `world.rng`
(`rng.ts`), and the core has no `Date.now`, `Math.random` or DOM (`mars/AGENTS.md`). `conformance.ts` checks: same seed
same hash, different seeds diverge, snapshot/restore mid-action continues identically, `physicalHash` ignores labels and
env, unknown verb returns `action.unknown-verb`. Note the host's `LogEvent.at = Date.now()` is wall time *outside* the
engine and is not hashed.

**Why bodies keep moving between inputs.** A `decision` becomes a `Program` (ordered engine verbs) via
`engine.perform` (`fold.ts:101-106`); `MarsEngine.step()` (`engine-mars/src/engine.ts:294`) then advances every program
each tick (`for (const p of this.programs.values()) this.advance(p)`), walks continue inside the Mars `Runtime`, and
the adapter cuts a take every 20 ticks and emits a keyframe `PathCommit` every `KEY_EVERY = 5` ticks. Between agent
inputs, `EdgeLedger.afterTick` (every 20 ticks) runs `ambientLife` and `BodyRule.sweep`, each of which may
`enqueueChecked('decision', 'edge:<id>', …)` with triggers `edge-ambient` / `edge-body` (`ledger.ts:201,560`).

**Three implementations.** `engine-toy` (`ToyEngine`, `engine-toy/src/engine.ts:37`) is the small reference engine for
tests and the `toy` world. `engine-mars` (`MarsEngine`) lazily imports `mars/viewer/engine/*` (`load.ts`), installs
Node's SHA-256 (`hashes.setSha256Provider`), lowers the shared body verbs (`BODY_VERBS`: walk_to, sit, rest, wave,
converse, gather, …) to Mars ops in `lower()` and passes raw Mars verbs through as `mars:<verb>`. **`engine-native` is
not an engine**: it holds humanoid stair qualification and lifecycle/crew-removal factory wrappers around `MarsEngine`
configs (`engine-native/src/*`). `packages/conformance` is likewise not an engine suite but a library-def sweep over
the world compiler's `coreLibrary` with append-only pinned findings in `packages/conformance/conformance/*.json`.

## 4. Kernel and world compiler

**Kernel** (`packages/kernel`): `Thing {id, kind, name, traits, states, at, born, by}`, `Link {kind, from, to, value?,
data?, since, until?}`, and `Change`, a union of **seven** ops (`appear | vanish | set | move | link | unlink | say`;
the file comment still says five, `types.ts:6,33`). `check(s, c, by)` throws `Refused {code}` under the coherence rule
(an actor changes only itself, what it controls, what it made; speech links only from `say`), `apply` mutates,
`applyAll` is the atomic batch, `sweep` drops lapsed links (`kernel.ts:20-126`). `Card` (`cardSchema`: target, derive,
when ≤ 8, then ≤ 8, approach, during, wants, takes) and `Playable = {card, target, id}` live in `cards.ts`; `Step` is
`z.infer<stepSchema>`. The kernel owns no physics: `initKernel` mirrors the engine's `anchors()` as place Things
(`fold.ts:38-47`), and a `play` event applies a card's `changesOf(...)` to the kernel after the engine has run its
approach steps (`world.ts:617-656`, `fold.ts:156`).

**World compiler** (`packages/world-compiler`): `plan(world, input, by, tick, opts)` works on `world.fork()` and returns
`{ok:true, apply(), ids, warnings, diff} | {ok:false, failures}`; `applyBatch` returns `{result: Accepted|Refused,
diff?, inverse?: Op[]}` (`compile.ts:128,682`). The `edit/1` batch is `{ops ≤ 256, clientRef, note, group}`; `opSchema`
has 17 kinds (place, remove, move, set, clone, define, undefine, world, expand, answer, restore, restore-def,
revive-def, economy, mint, pay, relate; `schemas.ts:362`), of which clients may send 14. Defs are `name@version`,
content-hashed, stored under both `sha:<hash>` and ref (`model.ts:141`); redefining pushes a `restore-def` inverse.
`coreLibrary()` is one frozen process-wide `DefLibrary` built from `CORE_KIT`; a world pins a def by hash on first use.
Limits are in `packages/generators/src/creation-limits.ts` (`CREATION_LIMITS`: 20,000 entities, 10,000 defs, 50 M tris,
1,024 solids per region, 256 ops per batch). `@sim/generators` (kit, buildings, roads, clearance) and `@sim/ground`
(terrain tiles, `settle`) are used by the compiler, the server and the web app alike.

## 5. Minds

`BRAIN_MODE` is `'fake'` only when the env says so; anything else is live (`config.ts:52`), and a missing API key also
forces fake (`packages/brain/src/jev.ts:32`, `narrator.ts:149`). `MIND_DRIVER` is `'edge' | 'central'`, default `edge`
(`config.ts:29`): in edge mode `Brain.afterTick` returns at once (`brain.ts:192`) and the `EdgeLedger` is built instead.
Model roles (`packages/brain/src`): **mid** (Jev, picks an `ActivityOption` id among engine-enumerated options),
**translate** (Jev → `WireIntent`), **director** (Jev, camera shots), **narrator** (Haiku, a 5-minute region `Plan` of
beats → `enqueue('scene')`), **compile** (Haiku, a wish → card agenda; also interprets intent-v2 directions), **talk**
(Haiku, speech words), reflection (Haiku, journal). Default model for the three Haiku roles is
`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (`config.ts:56-58`); Jev is `jev-1.13.0` at `api.typesafe.ai`.

**Budget.** `paidJson` (`paid.ts`) calls `gate(costBound(...))` before every `fetch`; the gate is `Db.reserveCost`
(`db.ts:33`), which refuses with `BudgetReservationUnavailable` when the rolling 24 h `SUM(cost)` of `paid_costs` plus
the bound exceeds `min(ceiling, budget)`. `worldThinkingBudgetV1` (`thinking-budget.ts`) allows a ceiling of 1 or 3
USD/day (3 only for the authorised Eden world); target default 0.5. `Governor` adds per-tier token buckets.

**Model output never enters the engine.** Every role returns an id among code-enumerated options or validated text,
and the result is enqueued as a `decision`, `scene` or `rules` event; `fold.ts` calls `engine.perform` from the log
(`fold.ts:3-6`). An unguided edge Soul moves only because the ledger's `ambientLife`/`BodyRule` enqueue native
decisions, none of which call a model.

## 6. The Soul edge

Every `/v1/edge/*` route resolves the Soul through `soulFromToken` and is mounted from `http.ts:94` →
`mountEdgeRoutes`. The request/response contract is `eden-edge/1` (`edge/contract.ts:9`), with boot responses
declaring the additive `eden-edge/1.1`.

| Surface | Routes | Module |
|---|---|---|
| Boot and context | `GET boot`, public `boot/static`, `boot/places`; `GET here[?include=doHere]`, `around`, `observe`, `capabilities` | `edge/boot/routes.ts`, `edge/routes.ts`, `edge/perception/here.ts` |
| Acting | `POST act` → `EdgeLedger.act` (`ledger.ts:837`); `POST resolve` (dry run); `GET receipts/:id` | `edge/routes.ts:58`, `edge/ledger` |
| Comms | `say`, `converse`, `conversations`, `objects/:id/act`, `wait` (1–55 s long-poll), `digest`, `calendar`, webhooks, steward queue | `edge/comms/index.ts` |
| Events | `GET events` (SSE), `events/ws`, `GET schema` | `edge/events` |
| Body, eyes, plans, reminders | `GET/PUT body`, `view`, `view/img/:file`, `plan`, `reminders` | `edge/body`, `edge/eyes`, `edge/plans`, `edge/reminders` |
| Outcomes | `content/catalogue`, `content/objects/:id`, `mail` | `edge/outcomes/routes.ts` |
| Owner-side | `/v1/souls/:id/intent-v2*`, `/v1/agent/intent-v2*`, inbox, `self/now`, `self/link`, `travel` | `http.ts`, `inbox-routes.ts`, `soul-now-routes.ts`, `travel/routes.ts` |

**Pairing and tokens.** A Soul token is `sim_<soulId>_<24 B base64url>`; only its sha256 is stored (`souls.token_hash`,
or `account_agent_grants_v1.token_hash` with accounts; `souls.ts:508-620`). Three flows exist: owner code
(`POST /v1/souls/:id/pair`), agent-initiated (`/v1/agent/pair/start` → browser `#pair/<code>` → `/v1/agent/pair/poll`),
and accounts (`/v1/agent/approval/start|poll` → `/v1/account/approvals/:id/approve`). Pending pairings are in memory
with a 15-minute TTL. `soul-link.ts` reduces this to `pairing | connected | disconnected`.

**Here.** `hereFrame(ledger, soul, {doHere})` (`here.ts:211`) builds a fresh `Perception` per request: clock, light,
weather, `me` (place path, pose, posture, activity, gaze, holding, fade), Souls within 30 m, objects within 15 m,
conversations in earshot, exits, floors; with `doHere` a byte-budgeted menu of ≤ 12 offered capabilities. Capabilities
come from `EdgeLedger.binds` → `readHumanCapabilitiesV1` (`human-capabilities.ts`), cached per (Soul, tick) in
`capCache`, which `act` clears on every acceptance (`ledger.ts:612,839`).

**One Soul action, CLI to render:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant A as eden-agent.mjs act
  participant R as edge/routes.ts
  participant L as EdgeLedger
  participant H as WorldHost
  participant E as MarsEngine
  participant Hub as hub.ts
  participant W as apps/web Replica
  A->>R: POST /v1/edge/act {capability, params, clientRef}
  R->>L: act(soul, input): binds(soul) → plan
  L->>L: INSERT edge_receipts_v1 (phase accepted)
  L->>H: enqueue('decision', 'edge:<soul>', {steps, trigger:'edge-act:<receipt>'})
  R-->>A: {accepted, receipt}
  Note over H: next tick
  H->>H: appendEvent(decision)
  H->>E: perform({actor, label, steps}) → ProgramAdmission
  loop each tick
    E->>E: step(): advance(program), walk, take recorder
    E-->>H: {paths, changes, programs: step|completed|failed}
    H->>L: onProgram → UPDATE receipt phase (started / completed / failed)
    H->>Hub: onBatch every 10 ticks, takes chunk every 20
  end
  Hub-->>W: {t:'batch'} / {t:'takes'}
  W->>W: Replica.applyBatch; takes playback moves the body
  A->>R: GET /v1/edge/receipts/:id or /v1/edge/wait
  R-->>A: receipt → outcome (edgeOutcomeV1Schema)
```

Intents v2 (`packages/protocol/src/intent-v2.ts`: `intentRequestV2Schema` op upsert/withdraw, `soul-intent/2`,
`intentOutcomeV2Schema`, `intentAdmissionPayloadV2Schema`, `intentControllerPayloadV2Schema`) are the *owner's*
direction channel: `IntentControlV2.submit` → `IntentPublisher` enqueues `intent-request-v2`, `Brain.compile`
interprets it, `intent-v2` is logged, and `host.enqueueIntentDecision` writes a `decision` plus a derived
`intent-admission-v2` fact in one transaction (`world.ts:683,734`). Mandates are kernel state (`mandate.ts`:
`foldMandate`, `MANDATE_STATE`). Lifecycle (`LifecycleJournal`, `LifecycleRunner`) creates and retires Souls through
`rules` and `retire` events when `edenCapabilities` is on. Eyes always computes a caption (`edge/eyes/sight.ts`); a
forked Playwright Chromium renders the viewer with `?eyes=1` only when `EDGE_EYES` is set.

**Continuity.** There is no server-side Soul memory runtime. The agent's own folder holds `memory/` (self, goals,
places, knowledge, lessons, ledger, schedule) via `memory-folder.mjs`; the world keeps only `edge_place_knowledge_v1`,
the ≤ 140-character `now` line (`soul_now_v1`, outside the log) and receipts. `purpose-recall.ts` / `purpose-episodes.ts`
feed only the *central* `Brain`. A continuity runtime would plug in at the CLI (`client-memory.mjs`, `client-living.mjs`)
and read `boot` + `here`, not into the world process.

**CLI.** `eden-agent.mjs` (v1.9.19) maps about forty commands (now, look, listen, here, observe, capabilities, act,
resolve, say, converse, object, wait, receipt, plan, events, view, travel, live, register, approval, pair-soul, …) onto
the `EDGE` route table (`eden-agent.mjs:45`); `live` spawns the `claude` CLI (codex or ollama as alternatives). It is
dependency-free and does not import `@sim/protocol`.

## 7. Protocol

`packages/protocol/src` is one shared wire contract for every consumer, not a browser package. Families and consumers:

| Family | Files | Consumers |
|---|---|---|
| Log events and hub messages | `index.ts`: `EventKind`, `LogEvent`, `Batch`, `Heartbeat`, `Snapshot`, `KernelView`, `ServerMsg`, `PROTO = 1`, `viewHashOf` | server (`world.ts`, `hub.ts`), `packages/client`, web |
| Intents | `intent-v2.ts`, `intent-history-page-v1.ts`, `intent-arrival-v1.ts`, `intent-sleep-stop-v1.ts` | server (19 files), web (7: `SoulHome.tsx`, …) |
| Pairing, Souls | `index.ts` `pair*Schema`, `createSoulSchema`; `soul-profile-v1.ts` | server, web pair pages |
| Mandates and owner views | `mandate.ts`, `owner-views.ts` (`steerReceiptSchema`, `ownerSoulDashboardSchema`) | server, `SoulHome.tsx`, `packages/brain/compile.ts` |
| Edge outcomes | `edge-outcome-v1.ts` (`edgeOutcomeV1Schema`) | `edge/contract.ts`, `edge/outcomes/store.ts` |
| Recorded takes | `take-chunk-wire.ts`, `take-boundary-wire.ts`, `take-entities-*`, `columns-v1.ts` | `hub.ts`, `packages/client/hello.ts`, web `WorldTakeTransport.ts` |
| Me-live, presentation, scene capture | `me-live.ts`, `presentation.ts`, `scene-capture.ts` | hub + client; web |
| Lifecycle | `lifecycle.ts`, `lifecycle-capability.ts` | lifecycle runner, `http.ts`, web |
| Body, station | `body-v1.ts`, `station-v1/v2`, `station-era-*` | `fold.ts`, hub, web score client |

Versioning is by file suffix (`-v1`, `-v2`) and by contract literals inside payloads (`soul-intent/2`, `eden-edge/1.1`,
`private-*/1`, `world-edit/1`). The three CLIs (`tools/edge-skill`, `tools/god-skill`, `tools/world-launcher`) consume
the JSON shapes over HTTP but import nothing from the package: a schema change there reaches them only through the
served `SKILL.md`/`SCHEMA.md`.

## 8. Presence

`packages/client` `Replica` holds `Snapshot` + applied `Batch`es; `applyBatch` returns false on a `seq` gap and
`Connection` resyncs; `check(Heartbeat)` compares `viewHash` at the heartbeat tick (`client/src/index.ts:17-113`).
`viewHashOf` is the first 16 hex chars of `hashOf` over sorted `[id, activity, on, pose[1], pose[3]]` rows for humans
(`protocol/src/index.ts:211`), computed by the host every 100 ticks (`world.ts:1600`). The hub's cadence is `batch`
every 10 ticks, `heartbeat` every 100, `takes` chunks every 20, `stats` every 2 s, `kernel` at most every 40 ticks when
dirty or every 200 (`hub.ts:125-138`, `world.ts:1631`); limits `MAX_PER_IP = 30`, `MAX_CLIENTS = 2000`.

`apps/web`: `main.tsx` → `page-route.ts` picks list or world; `useSim.ts` opens `new Connection(<worldPath>/ws)`
(`useSim.ts:57`); `snapshot-prefetch.ts` fetches `/v1/world/snapshot?defs=ref&cols=1` from an inline head script;
`LiveWorld.tsx` owns the three.js renderer (`:275-323`) and plays bodies from the socket's `takes` stream, with history
from `GET /v1/takes` (`WorldTakeTransport.ts`). God panel: `GodPanel.tsx` + `god-ui/`. Soul pages: `SoulHome.tsx`,
`MySouls.tsx`, `SoulDay.tsx`, `PairApprove.tsx`. Clerk via `ClerkBridge.tsx` and `LauncherRoot.tsx`. Assets resolve
through `cdn-assets.ts` (`readCdnManifest`, `manifestAsset`, `cdnFetch` with a 4 s hedge) against `src/cdn-manifest.json`
(origin path → `{key: assets/[br/]xx/<sha256>.<ext>, sha256, bytes}`), origin fixed to `https://assets.eden.art`.
`visitor-counts.ts` posts to GoatCounter by `sendBeacon`: path `/w/<slug>` or `/`, referrer origin, screen width, and
three events (`enter world`, `soul paired`, `god connected`), skipping `navigator.webdriver`, `?shot`, `skipgc` and
local hosts.

## 9. God mode

`GodMode` (`god/god.ts`) owns the entity model and pairing (`pairStart` 8-char code, 15 min; `pairApprove` by admin,
first claimant or owner; `pairPoll` hands out `god_<worldId>_<b64>`, stored hashed in `god_tokens_v1`). `commitBatch`
(`god.ts:379`) is the one authoring path: schema → retry receipt → preview binding (`revision.stale`) → helper gate →
`builds.admit` → `applySafe` → walkouts → `store.commit` → `publish`. **BUILDSAFE** (`god/buildsafe.ts:212`,
`buildsafe-rule.ts` re-exporting the generators' clearance rule) tags place ops, replays the batch on a fork and appends
repair ops (nudge 0.15–1.5 m, turn, or cut a 1 m gate) to the *same* batch, so repairs are journaled and undoable.
`EngineBridge` (`god/engine-bridge.ts`) coalesces every commit since the last tick into **one** `world-edit` event per
tick (`flush()`, `:374`), and engine-originated changes (a Soul takes an item) go back the other way as trusted `move`
ops by `'engine'`, not undoable. Helpers (`god/helpers.ts`): child tokens scoped to one claim, 2 h default TTL, only
place/remove/move/set/clone/define. Preview: `pv_<hex>` kept in memory 10 min, committed with `POST /act {preview}`.
Trace: an in-memory ring of 1,024 rows; a "loop" is the same refusal three times in two minutes. Uploads are
content-addressed under `$ASSET_DIR/<sha256>.<ext>`, shared by every world on the box (`god/assets.ts`). Context views
(`god/context-views.ts`) render architectural pictures through headless Chrome under a host-wide render slot and cache
pixels in `context_views_v1`. Co-builders exist in code but are refused unless `SIM_COBUILDERS=1` (`main.ts:153`).

`tools/god-skill/eden-god.mjs` is generated by `build.mjs` from `cli.mjs` + `lib/`; its ~90 subcommands (`cli.mjs:1455`)
all speak HTTP with a Bearer token, mostly to `/v1/god/act`, `dryrun`, `preview`, `query`, `snapshot`, `undo`, `redo`.
The CLI does not run the compiler locally (it imports only `obbOverlap`), contrary to the header comment in `compile.ts`.

## 10. Platform

**Launcher** (`tools/world-launcher`): `openLauncher()` binds 4980 by default, children on 5101–5149 (`launcher.mjs:
145-146`; production uses `--range 4621-4659`, staging `4601-4619`, `deploy/install.sh`). `Registry` keeps
`<data>/worlds.json` (`world-launcher-registry/1`); templates are `worlds/templates/*.json` (`genesis/1`).
`createWorld` verifies the creator (`creator-auth.mjs` spawning `verify-creator.mjs`), applies `creation-policy.mjs`
(5 worlds per account; new accounts 2 and one per hour), then `pool.ensure` and `POST /w/<slug>/v1/god/claim` with the
creator's own token. `children.mjs defaultCommand` (`:405-454`) starts `node apps/server/src/main.ts` with
`BRAIN_MODE=fake`, empty provider keys, `ENGINE=mars`, `ENABLE_WORLD_ENGINE=1`, `WORLD_KEY=<slug>`, `DATA_DIR`,
`PUBLIC_URL`, `WORLD_PATH`, `SIM_UNWATCHED_PACE=0.25`, `SOUL_LIFECYCLE=1`, `EDGE_FADING=1`, and either
`AUTH_PROVIDER=clerk` + `ACCOUNT_REGISTRY_PATH` (with `--auth-env`) or `DEV_AUTH=1`. The launcher↔child contract is
HTTP only: `GET healthz` (boot poll), `/v1/config`, `/v1/god/status`, `/v1/world/souls`, `/v1/god/claim`,
`/v1/op/souls/*`, `/v1/op/god/*`, `/v1/site/*` with a per-run `x-sim-site-key`, plus read-only opens of the child's
`sim.db` (`worldOwner`). Idle: `SIGSTOP` after 10 min without non-passive requests or sockets, `SIGTERM` after another
60 min; LRU eviction against `maxRunning`/`minFreeMb`; restart backoff `min(30 s, 500·2ⁿ)`. Release handover is
`keeper.mjs` holding the port and `SIGHUP` handing worlds to a new launcher generation with a `/v1/config` canary.

**Auth.** `Auth` (`auth.ts`) verifies Clerk RS256 JWTs against the issuer JWKS when `ACCOUNT_AUTH_REQUIRED=1`;
`DEV_AUTH=1` accepts `dev:` tokens and refuses to start beside Clerk or an https `PUBLIC_URL`. Identity lives in the
shared `accounts.sqlite`; memberships, grants and approvals live per world (`accounts/store.ts`). `MAX_SOULS_PER_USER`
(default 20) is counted per world, not per site (`souls.ts:159,206`).

**Release and gates.** `deploy/release.sh` builds `git archive HEAD` with the web at `--base /worlds/`, build id
`we-<sha12>`, pulls assets from the CDN, `activate.sh` reloads and health-checks. Gates: `release-gate.mjs` (V1–V6),
`walk/walk.mjs` (walkability vs baseline), `bundle-budget/budget.mjs` (≥ 10 % growth fails), the Modal remote gate
once per release head. CI picks jobs from changed paths (`.github/scripts/ci-scope.mjs`).

## 11. Contracts table

| Contract | Producer | Consumers | Versioning | What breaks when it changes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Engine` / `EngineFactory` (`packages/engine-contract`) | each engine package | `WorldHost`, `fold.ts`, `Brain`, `EdgeLedger`, hub | `rulesVersion` string, `DT` constant, `canReplayHistory`, conformance tests | snapshots stop restoring, replay hashes diverge, `boot()` throws `clock-frontier.rules-incompatible` |
| Event log (`EventKind`, `LogEvent`, payload schemas) | `WorldHost.drainInputs` | `fold.ts`, hub `log`, replay tools | new kinds are added, never reinterpreted; behaviour changes ship as logged `rules` facts | old worlds replay differently; `world-edit` hash mismatch logs |
| Hub wire (`PROTO = 1`, `Batch`, `Heartbeat`, `Snapshot`, takes, `columns/1`) | `hub.ts` | `packages/client`, `apps/web` | `PROTO`, `epoch` in `welcome`, hello capability negotiation (`hello.ts`) | viewers get `error proto`; resync storms on seq semantics |
| Protocol schema families (`packages/protocol`) | server | web, client, brain | `-v1/-v2` files, literals (`soul-intent/2`) | typecheck across apps; owner pages mis-parse |
| `eden-edge/1` + `1.1` (`edge/contract.ts`) and the `eden-agent.mjs` command surface | `edge/*` routes; served `SKILL.md` and CLI | every Soul's agent, world-launcher tests | additive fields only; CLI version string | every paired Soul in the wild; the CLI is downloaded from the world, so skew is per world |
| `edgeOutcomeV1Schema`, receipts (`edge_receipts_v1`) | `EdgeLedger`, `ActionOutcomes` | CLI `receipt`/`wait`, owner dashboards | `eden-edge/1.1` | agents misread success/failure |
| God surface: `edit/1` batch, `god-schema/1`, refusal codes, `eden-lock/1` | `god/routes.ts`, `world-compiler`, served `SCHEMA.md`/`LOCKS.md` | `eden-god.mjs`, god panel | `clientOpSchema`, `refusalCodes`, def `name@version` | god CLIs refuse or mis-plan; `SCHEMA.md` is already stale (9 ops listed, 14 accepted) |
| `world-edit/1` (`WorldEditV1`) | `EngineBridge.flush` | `fold.ts` → `engine.applyWorldEditV1` | payload `hash` of derived physics | replay logs hash mismatch; viewers and physics disagree |
| World JSON / templates (`genesis/1`, `worlds/templates/*.json`) | authors, launcher | `createWorld`, `GodMode` genesis batches | `genesis/1` literal | new worlds fail to create; existing ones unaffected |
| Takes (`mars-take/4`, `take-chunk-wire`, `take-boundary-wire`) | Mars take recorder, `hub.ts`, `/v1/takes` | web playback, `TakeArchive`, R2 | decoders accept `/1–/4`; hello negotiation | stored history unreadable; Eyes renders stale |
| Snapshot (`sim-mars-snapshot/1`, `SnapshotBody`) | `WorldHost.saveSnapshot`, `MarsEngine` | `boot()`, recovery recipes | `format`, `rulesVersion`, `canRestoreSnapshot` | restart replays from genesis or refuses to boot |
| Launcher ↔ world (`healthz`, `/v1/config`, `/v1/god/claim`, `/v1/op/*`, `x-sim-site-key`, env contract) | `children.mjs` | `apps/server` | none explicit; env names | worlds never report healthy; creation rollback |
| `local-worlds/1` (`__sim/worlds.json`), `account-soul-approval/1`, `travel/1` | launcher, server | web list page, CLIs | literals in `/v1/config` | world list and pairing UIs |
| CDN manifest (`cdn-manifest.json`, `tools/assets/manifest.json`) | `tools/cdn/publish.mjs` | `apps/web cdn-assets.ts`, `pnpm assets:pull`, CI | content-addressed keys, immutable | missing media in CI and in the viewer (never a wrong byte) |
| Conformance pins (`packages/conformance/conformance/*.json`) | library def revisions | `conformance.test.ts`, remote gate | append-only supplements | gate fails until a supplement is added |

## 12. Hot paths and known bottlenecks

Everything below runs on the one Node thread of the world process; "tick" means inside `tickOnce`, "request" means a
synchronous handler that delays the next frame.

| # | Where | Thread | What it does | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | `MarsEngine.step()` | tick | lists the entity table (~4,500 entries on Eden 2026, "over a quarter of an idle tick" before S1 r2), steps carriers, runtime, programs, take cut | `engine-mars/src/engine.ts:294-320` |
| H2 | `EdgeLedger.binds` → `readHumanCapabilitiesV1` | request | iterates every `engine.anchors()` and verb, all minds, all entities (campfire scan), all regions; cached per (Soul, tick) but cleared on every accepted act | `ledger.ts:612`, `human-capabilities.ts` |
| H3 | `hereFrame` / `Perception` | request | rebuilt per `here`, `around`, `boot`; `things()` scans all `w.entities`, `solids()` maps all `navV1.solids` | `edge/perception/here.ts:27,211` |
| H4 | `buildLedgerBoot` | request | static boot pack rebuilt per request (ETag, no stored cache) | `edge/boot/routes.ts`, `boot-pack.ts` |
| H5 | `EdgeLedger.afterTick` | tick, every 20 | `ambientLife` (a `db.soul()` read per mind + all open conversations), `BodyRule.sweep`, `together.sweep`; `unstick` every 100 | `ledger.ts:501-520` |
| H6 | `EngineBridge.afterTick` | tick | `flush`, `writeBack` slices every 10 ticks, `perceiveStep`, `spotsStep`, `layersStep`, `navStep` while nav is cold | `god/engine-bridge.ts:217` |
| H7 | `viewHash()` + `kernelView()` | tick, every 100 / 40 | hashes every human's pose; clones the whole kernel for broadcast | `world.ts:1594-1631` |
| H8 | Hub join / resync | request | `snapshotView()` clones all entities + `JSON.stringify`; `holdClock` parks the frame while a join set goes out | `hub.ts:206-242`, `world.ts:429` |
| H9 | Periodic snapshot | tick + slices | synchronous capture, then encode/serialize/write in 4 ms `setImmediate` slices; a failed checkpoint stops the clock | `world.ts:1700-1760` |
| H10 | Frame budget | tick | ≤ 40 ticks per frame, 1 s elapsed cap, dilation to `baseRate/4` after 3 overruns | `world.ts:443-452` |
| H11 | Heap | process | `--max-old-space-size=768` from `--world-heap-mb 768` in both deploy units | `production.mjs:127`, `deploy/install.sh:24,33` |
| H12 | Context views / Eyes | request → subprocess | headless Chrome renders under one host-wide render slot; sheets in a worker thread | `god/context-views.ts`, `edge/eyes/render-worker.mjs` |

H2–H5 are the "per-Soul context and menu rebuilt on the tick thread" cost: a world with *n* active Souls pays
H2 + H3 on every `here`/`act` and H5 for every mind every second, all between two engine steps. H1 scales with
entity count regardless of Souls. The repo's own docs state almost none of this; `docs/mars/planning-budget.md`
(`REPLANS_PER_TICK = 4`) and the S1 r2 comment in `MarsEngine.step` are the only written budget claims.

## Where this map disagrees with older docs

- [architecture.md](../architecture.md) says a Soul's action "becomes a `decision` event"; edge acts also log
  `edge-stop`, `edge-relocate`, `edge-attention` and `body-assignment-v1`, and a god commit becomes one `world-edit`
  **per tick**, not per commit (`god/engine-bridge.ts:374`).
- It says the world "makes no model calls for Soul decisions"; with `edenCapabilities`, intent-v2 directions are
  interpreted by `Brain.compile` (a Haiku call under the budget), though the resulting choice is still a logged event.
- It and [worlds.md](worlds.md) say launcher children run Clerk sign-in; children get `DEV_AUTH=1` unless the launcher
  was started with `--auth-env` (production is, staging is not: `deploy/install.sh:24,33`).
- "There are no co-builders": the code path exists behind `SIM_COBUILDERS=1`, off by default.
- [souls.md](souls.md) names one pairing flow and a two-minute listen grace; three flows exist and
  `SOUL_LISTEN_GRACE_MS` is 60 s (`inbox.ts:40`).
- `packages/engine-native` is not a third engine, and `packages/conformance` is not the engine conformance suite (that
  is `engine-contract/src/conformance.ts`).
