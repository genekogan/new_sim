# The engine contract

`packages/engine-contract` is the seam between the world server and any engine. Two engines implement it: the Mars
adapter (`packages/engine-mars`, `ENGINE=mars`, used by every launcher world) and the toy engine
(`packages/engine-toy`, the default when `ENGINE` is unset). Names mirror the Mars engine
([engine snapshot](../mars/ENGINE-SNAPSHOT.md)).

## Shared types

| Here | Mars source |
|---|---|
| `WorldState`, `Entity`, `Region`, `Pose`, `Environment`, `physicalView` (`world.ts`) | `world/types.ts` |
| `hashOf`, `stableStringify`, `sha256` (`hash.ts`) | `core/hash.ts` |
| `RngState`, `seedRng` (`rng.ts`) | `core/rng.ts` |
| `Runtime`, `DT = 1/20`, `RuntimeEvent`, `Invariant` (`runtime.ts`) | `runtime/runtime.ts` |
| `ActionDef`, `ActionRecord`, `Diagnostic`, `Reservation` (`actions.ts`) | `actions/types.ts` |
| `createRegistry`, `describeVerbs`, `jsonSchemaOf` (`registry.ts`) | `api/registry.ts` |
| `PoseSample = [tick, x mm, y mm, z mm, yaw mrad]` | `take/types.ts` |

## What the server needs from an engine (`engine.ts`)

```ts
interface Engine {
  rulesVersion: string; dt: number; schema: string;
  runtime: RuntimeView; world: WorldState;
  describeVerbs(): VerbInfo[];                         // { verb, description, inputSchema, scope? }
  stateHash(): string; physicalHash(): string;
  step(): { paths; changes; events; programs };        // what changed this tick, for broadcast and the host
  perform(program): { id; ok; diagnostic? };           // start a program, replacing what the actor was doing
  stop(programId): void;                               // request a stop; committed physical work may finish safely
  canPerform(program): { code; message } | null;       // is the first step feasible now? no side effects
  programOf(actor): string | null;
  submit(verb, params, opts?); cancel(id, reason?);
  snapshot(): EngineSnapshot;                          // opaque to the server except { format, tick, stateHash }
  spawnHuman({ id, label, soul }): string; removeEntity(id): void;
  anchors(): Anchor[];                                 // regions and named places; stable ids
  describeSurroundings(actorId); regionAt(p); poseSampleOf(id); currentPath(id);
  enumerateActivities(actorId, intent);                // toy tests only
}
interface EngineFactory { rulesVersion; genesis(seed); create(world); restore(snap); canRestoreSnapshot?; canReplayHistory? }
```

Optional hooks cover recorded takes and scenes (`takeChunks`, `renderScene`, `takeScene`), snapshots and checkpoints
(`canSnapshot`, `captureSnapshot`, `captureCheckpoint`, `compact`), clocks and policies (`configureClock`,
`configureRuntimePolicy`, `beginQuiet`, `isQuiet`), body assignment (`assignBodyV1`), admission previews
(`previewAdmission`) and a set of paired `preview*V1` / `adopt*V1` transitions that add authored content to an existing
world as logged, replayable facts. The declarations are the reference.

- **Program** `{ actor, label, steps: {verb, params}[] }`: the verb steps one body runs. A `decision` event starts one.
  One actor runs one program.
- **ProgramEvent** `{ tick, id, actor, kind: 'step'|'completed'|'failed'|'cancelled', step, code?, message? }`: how the
  host learns that an action progressed, finished or was refused. Receipts are built from these.
- **Anchor** `{ id, kind: 'region'|'place', name, in?, entity?, point?, tags? }`: mirrored as kernel Things at genesis;
  the place tagged `arrival` is where new Souls appear.
- **VerbInfo.scope** `'world'` marks a verb that belongs to one engine, not the shared body language.
- An unknown verb fails with `action.unknown-verb`.

## Body language

Both engines describe the same shared verbs for one actor's body; the actor is implied by the program:
`walk_to {to, standoff?}` · `sit {on, seconds?}` · `stand` · `rest {seconds?}` · `wave {at?, seconds?}` ·
`converse {with, seconds?}` · `gather {at, seconds?}` · `perform {what?, seconds?}` · `ambient_wander {seconds?, radius?}`.
Edge capabilities offered to Souls are built on top of these and the engine's own verbs.

## Conformance

`@sim/engine-contract/conformance` exports `conformance(name, factory, drive)`: same seed and inputs give the same hash,
different seeds diverge, snapshot/restore mid-action continues identically, `physicalHash` ignores labels, verbs
describe with JSON Schema, an unknown verb fails cleanly. Both engines run it (`packages/engine-mars/src/mars.test.ts`,
`packages/engine-toy/src/toy.test.ts`). (`packages/conformance` is a different gate: every core-library object bakes,
places and furnishes within budget.)

## The Mars adapter (`packages/engine-mars`)

The Mars engine is hard-forked under `mars/viewer/engine`. `load.ts` imports that in-repo tree (it fails if
`runtime/runtime.ts` is missing) and installs a Node SHA-256 provider with the same digests as the browser.

- **World configurations** (`engine.ts`): `GREEN_FIELD_WORLD` (launcher worlds and `eden`), `LITTLE_MARTIANS_WORLD`,
  Eden commons variants, the default proving ground (`mars`), and `MEAL_WORLD` for a test. `main.ts` picks one from
  `WORLD_KEY`. Rules version is `sim-mars/1+<Mars rules version>`, extended with the policies a world has adopted.
- **Lowering.** Each body-language step becomes Mars actions when it begins: `walk_to` plans a reachable point near the
  target and faces it; `sit` and `gather` take a fixture or region; `converse` joins two bodies when both are free;
  `rest` and `perform` wait; `ambient_wander` draws short legs from the world RNG.
- **Raw verbs.** Every Mars verb is also described as `mars:<verb>` with `scope: 'world'`.
- **One program per actor.** A program that moves the body first asks whatever holds it (a seat, a circle, a
  conversation) to release it, and fails with `actor.busy` if that takes too long. Feasibility is checked first
  (`canPerform`) because in Mars a refused instruction still disturbs the actor.
- **Broadcast.** Moving bodies send two-point keyframe paths every 5 ticks; activity and seat changes are field changes.
- **Snapshot** format `sim-mars-snapshot/1`: Mars's own snapshot plus the adapter's programs and world configuration.
  A program whose actions cannot be serialized defers the checkpoint; replay of the logged suffix continues it.
- **God-built worlds.** On launcher worlds the god's committed objects and terrain enter the engine as `world-edit`
  physics through `apps/server/src/god/engine-bridge.ts`; Souls then sit on, walk around and use them.

## The toy engine (`packages/engine-toy`)

A 100 × 100 m plane with a campfire, benches, a kiosk and a gate, two regions, straight timed walking at 1.35 m/s in
integer millimetres, and the shared verbs plus `do_activity`. It is a small reference for the contract and the
`toy` world's tests.
