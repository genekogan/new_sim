# Agent workflow

Several coding agents (and people) work on Sim at once without a coordinator. They stay out of each other's way
through a few repository conventions, and the merge train decides the order in which their work lands on `main`.
[Agent lifecycle](agent-lifecycle.md) is the path one piece of work takes; this page is how many of them share the
repository.

## Working in parallel

- **An issue is a lock.** Before starting, an agent assigns the issue to itself (or to the person running it) and adds
  the `agent:claimed` label. Nobody else starts on a claimed issue; to take one over, ask in the issue. Pick from
  issues labelled `agent:ready`. Unclaim (remove the label, unassign) when you stop without a PR.
- **One branch per issue:** `agent/<issue>-<slug>`, for example `agent/412-reading-seat`, cut from the current
  `origin/main`. One worktree per branch when several agents share a machine. Never commit to `main`, never
  force-push a branch someone else is reviewing.
- **Small PRs.** A PR does one thing and can be reviewed in one sitting. A large issue is split into issues that each
  merge on their own; link them from a `type:epic` issue.
- **Feature flags for unfinished work.** Work that is not ready for visitors merges behind a flag that defaults to off,
  rather than living on a long branch. Remove the flag in a follow-up once the feature ships.
- **Plans live in issues.** Briefs, status and findings go in the issue and its comments, never in files in the tree.

## Conventions that avoid conflicts

Two PRs that both append to one shared file conflict every time. So nothing a PR routinely adds goes in a shared file:

| Instead of | Do |
|---|---|
| editing `CHANGELOG.md` | add one fragment, `changes/<pr-or-slug>.md` ([format](../../changes/README.md)); the `release` workflow compiles the fragments into `CHANGELOG.md` |
| editing an existing conformance record | add a new supplement for your change in `packages/conformance/conformance/` ([conformance](../../packages/conformance/conformance/README.md)); older supplements are never edited |
| committing generated output | let CI build it: the changelog, the web build and gate receipts are produced by workflows, not committed by PRs |
| re-pinning a baseline inside a feature commit | regenerate the walk or bundle baseline (`--write`) in its own commit, with the reason in the message, after rebasing |

## The merge train

When a PR is ready, label it `merge:ready`. From there the train takes over, one PR at a time:

1. **Rebase** the branch onto the current `main`.
2. **Re-test**: the required checks (`ci-ok` from the `ci` workflow, `gitleaks`, `path-guard`, `scrub-guard`,
   `proof-ok` and `fragment`) run on the rebased head, and the train waits for them there (a personal-account repo
   has no GitHub merge queue; `merge-train.yml` is the queue), so `main` never gets a commit tested only against an
   older base.
3. **Merge**, by tier ([PROOF-POLICY.yml](PROOF-POLICY.yml), `node tools/proof/tier.mjs`):
   - **T0–T2** merge automatically once every required check is green.
   - **T3–T4** wait for the maintainer's approval, then merge.

   The maintainer gate lives in the required `proof-ok` check, not only in the train: for a T3 or T4 PR, `proof-ok`
   fails until the maintainer's latest decisive review is an approval or, on a PR the maintainer authored (GitHub
   forbids self-approval), until they add `approved:maintainer` themselves (the label's actor is read from the PR's
   events; a label someone else added does not count). Approvals and labels re-run the check. The `main` ruleset
   requires no approving review, so that T0–T2 merge on green; without the gate in `proof-ok`, `gh pr merge --auto`
   would land a T3/T4 PR around the train. The rule is `tools/proof/gate.mjs`; the train reads the same rule only to
   leave unapproved PRs queued. The check trusts GitHub identity, so agents never approve a PR or add
   `approved:maintainer` or `proof:waived`, and never act with the maintainer's account to do so.
4. **On a conflict**, a Claude step tries to resolve it on the branch and re-runs the checks. If it can't produce a
   clean, green rebase, it labels the PR `needs:rebase` and comments with what conflicted; the author rebases by hand
   and relabels `merge:ready`.

A PR that fails a check leaves the train with its result in the PR; fix it and relabel.

## Review

- **Claude reviews every PR.** The `claude-review` workflow reviews each non-draft PR against [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)
  and [PROOF-POLICY.yml](PROOF-POLICY.yml), states the PR's proof tier, and keeps one review comment up to date on
  later pushes. Answer each finding with a fix or a reason.
- **`@claude` for follow-ups.** Mention `@claude` in an issue, PR comment or review (the `claude` workflow) to ask a
  question, iterate on review feedback or have it push a fix to the PR branch. Only the owner, members and
  collaborators can trigger it.
- **Proof tiers.** The PR states its tier and links its proof: lint (T0); focused tests and typecheck (T1); an uncut,
  real-speed clip of the changed journey (T2, the `proof` skill records it); a scenario playtest, a reviewer-agent
  pass and maintainer sign-off (T3). T4 is the release head. What a reviewer checks: [review](review.md).

## Who starts agents

There are no scheduled agents. Nothing wakes up on a timer to pick issues, open PRs or ship releases. The maintainer
starts agents, oversees them and gives the go-ahead for anything above T2 and for every release. The only automation
that runs on its own is CI (`ci`, `security`, `changelog`, `claude-review`, label sync), which checks work and never
starts it.

## Repository skills and agents

`.claude/skills/` holds the repo's skills as plain Markdown that any agent can read: `triage` (label and reproduce new
issues), `finish` (turn a working change into a finished PR), `proof` (record the tier clip), `e2e` (browser
scenarios) and `sim-director` (direct live Souls). `.claude/agents/` defines the `lane` implementer (one issue, end
to end, to a draft PR) and the `reviewer`.
