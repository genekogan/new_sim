# Soul Actions: what Souls do by hand

Souls now use the things in a world with their own hands. Ask in plain words and the Soul walks over, reaches, and the
thing changes at the moment the hand touches it: a lamp lights, a door swings, water runs, the kettle clicks on. The
change is part of the world: it survives a restart, and every visitor sees the same motion on the same clock.

This page covers Soul Actions entries 1–44. Each entry was accepted with a deterministic native test (including the
context-size checks below), regression runs, and an uncut real-client recording driven by plain words.

## How it works

- **Opt-in things.** Hand contact belongs to library defs tagged for it (`hand-operated`, `hand-writable`, `hand-rung`,
  `upright-carry`, containers with an `inside`, the tea defs, and so on). Older revisions of a def keep their old,
  hand-free behaviour, so existing worlds do not change until a god places the new revision.
- **Plain words.** Everyday phrases resolve to the offers a Soul has where it stands. "turn on", "switch on" and
  "light" all mean switching on; "shut" means close; "wipe" or "clean" mean erase; "put up" means pin; "tune" or "change
  the station" mean the radio's station. A word only applies when that action is on offer.
- **Contact, then change.** The body walks to a stand point clear of the thing, turns to face it, and reaches. The
  world changes at the recorded contact: at the end of a door's swing, at the click of a switch, at the first knock.
  If the hand cannot get there (something in the way, out of reach, already in use), the act is refused with a reason
  and nothing changes.
- **Natural motion.** Reaches, walks starting and stopping, idle gestures and let-gos blend on shared clocks so nothing
  pops between frames. The viewer draws these from the recorded motion, never from a second movement path.

## What Souls can do

| Family | What a Soul can do | Plain words that work |
|---|---|---|
| Lights and fire | Switch lamps, string lights and neon signs on and off; light and put out candles, lanterns, torches and a campfire | "turn on the reading lamp", "switch off the string lights", "light the candle", "put out the campfire", "light the torch" |
| Doors and openings | Open and close doors, windows, cupboard and locker doors, fridge doors, curtains, blinds and drawers; doors open on the way while walking somewhere; knock; the owner locks and unlocks; anyone inside can always walk out | "open the garden door", "close the window", "close the curtains", "open the blind", "open the drawer", "knock on the door", "lock the door" |
| Water and garden | Turn taps, an outdoor shower, a sprinkler and a fountain on and off; fill a watering can at the tap and water a bed; planters dry out over the days and grow in stages | "turn on the garden tap", "turn off the outdoor shower", "turn on the fountain", "water the rose bed" |
| Carrying and things | Carry an upright load or a chair with both hands and set it down somewhere; pick up a lantern or a bowl and set it on a table; hand a carried thing to another Soul, who accepts or declines; put small things into a drawer or locker and take them out | "carry the bench to the courtyard" (any place name), "pick up the lantern", "put the bowl on the table", "give the lantern to Ben" then "accept", "put the bowl in the chest", "take the bowl out of the chest" |
| Writing and boards | Write on and wipe whiteboards and chalkboards; pin and take down notes; sign a sign-up sheet; vote in a poll; put up and take down posters; post wanted and offered notes, reply to them and take one on | "write on the whiteboard: Choir practice Thursday at six", "wipe the chalkboard", "sign the sign-up sheet", "vote on the poll", "take down my note from the pinboard", "reply to Ben's note" |
| Music | Ring a bell pull; play the piano and the drums, alone or as a duet on one shared clock; sing at a microphone with an accompanist; turn on a jukebox or a radio and change its station. Visitors hear all of these. | "ring the bell", "play the piano", "play the nearest drums", "sing at the microphone", "stop singing", "turn on the jukebox", "change the station" |
| Play and social | Frisbee with clear lanes and three-person triangles; noughts and crosses with honest turns; rock-paper-scissors and holding hands, both by consent | "mark the centre", "wipe the game board for a new game", "play rock-paper-scissors with Bea" then "accept" |
| Food | Make tea: fill the kettle at the sink, switch it on, wait for the boil and pour; carry a mug, offer it to someone, drink it in sips, and rinse the mug | "fill the kettle", "put the kettle on", "pour the tea", "make a cup of tea", "offer Ben the tea", "drink the tea", "rinse the mug", "wash up" |
| Media | Switch a screen on and off by its physical control; the image or video it shows stays the same | "turn on the screen", "switch off the screen" |

## What other Souls perceive

A Soul's `here` frame lists a few nearby things with compact facts, and only for things in the same enclosed place,
within about 4 m and in plain sight:

- switches and fire: `on`; doors, windows, curtains and drawers: `open` (and `locked` for lockable doors);
- a radio that is on: its `station`; an open drawer or locker: what it `holds` (names only; nothing while shut);
- a planter: `dry` only when dry, and its growth `stage`; a kettle: its phase (cold, heating, boiling, hot);
  a mug: how much `tea` is left, `empty` once drunk, `clean` once washed;
- a neon sign's words, attributed to whoever wrote them and marked untrusted;
- who is holding hands, who is offering a hand-over, and who is holding what.

Board text is never in ambient perception: a Soul reads a board on purpose ("read the whiteboard"). Knocks are heard
by the Souls the door shuts in, on the other side.

**Distant things cost nothing.** Every entry's native test measures the `here` frame with the thing absent, with 100 of
them far away, and nearby. Far-away things add 0 bytes and no offers, and no per-tick work, so a world full of lamps,
taps and mugs never distracts a Soul who is not using them. The `doHere` offer list in a frame stays inside its byte
budget: in a crowded spot it lists fewer offers rather than growing.

## Limits and known follow-ups

Fixes found in review and deferred to after the repository migration:

- **Ankles on every humanoid.** Many bodies show a gap between trousers and shoes. The fix belongs in the body, outfit
  or shoe meshes for every humanoid (the parked mixed-outfit seams work is likely the same family).
- **Garden revival.** Watered plants jump to full size at once but sag gradually; revival should be as gradual as drying.
  Watering and drying should become opt-in per planter or world, so a world without a watering routine does not wilt.
- **Noughts and crosses facing.** After a turn a player turns their back to the board; both should keep facing the board
  or each other between turns.
- **Rock-paper-scissors hand path.** Readying the hand can pass through the body; it needs a path clear of the torso.
- **Holding hands.** The clasp curls the fingers back and the right hand reads as a left (thumb on the wrong side).
- **Piano hands.** The pianist's hands sit below the keys; they should rest on and strike the keys at keyboard height
  (also for the piano duet).
- **Social facing in general.** Groups and conversations should face each other, and a Soul using an object should face
  it; today Souls often keep the heading they arrived with.

Other known limits:

- The idle look-around gesture moves a hand quickly on its own (about 0.17 m per 50 ms).
- Picking up something at the back of a counter bends the body deeply.
- At a hand-over the model's record of who holds the item lags the engine by a few samples.
- The `here` frame lists at most two things of a kind (three seats); more appear only as a count under `more`.
- Some new defs are over the library's geometry budgets: triangles for the fountain, jukebox, curtained window, drum kit,
  drawer chests, watering can, mic stand, kettle, mug and bell pull, and draw calls for the newest door and locker
  revisions. They need lighter meshes, or recorded budget holds with reasons, before release.
- Portable lights were rebuilt as carry-and-set-down (entry 29); the earlier version is retired. Mixed-outfit seams
  (entry 11) remain parked.

## Tests

Each family has a deterministic native test that runs a real server and engine in-process, with no ports and no models:

```sh
node --test --test-concurrency=1 tools/soul-actions/<name>.test.mjs
```

Set `SOUL_ACTIONS_OUT=<dir>` to keep each test's `summary.json` with its `here` byte counts. The tests live in
`tools/soul-actions/`; the viewer's motion units are under `apps/web/test/`, `apps/web/src/*.test.ts`,
`mars/viewer/engine/test/` and `mars/viewer/app/engine-view/`.
