# SCHEMA — the vocabulary of this world (generated from GET /v1/god/schema)

contract god-schema/1. Regenerate: `node eden-god.mjs schema --md > SCHEMA.md`.

## Conventions
- **units**: metres, radians; +x east, +z south, +y up; origin at the world centre
- **yaw**: rotation about +y; a thing's front faces +z at yaw 0 (buildings: the `front` side); facing a point (dx, dz) is yaw = atan2(dx, dz)
- **position**: p: [x, z] rests on whatever is below (ground, floor, water for anchor float); [x, y, z] keeps y (local to the parent frame)
- **forms**: point defs take p; path defs take shape.path (+ width); area defs take shape.area
- **addressing**: ids (e_…), paths of names (cottage/kitchen/chair-1); in a batch, tmp ids ($c) refer to things placed earlier in it
- **layers**: solid collides with solid and bodies; surface drapes (roads, lawns); volume is inside-able (water); decor never collides
- **rooms**: buildings expose each room as a slot of kind room: in: {parent: house, slot: "kitchen"}, p local to the room origin
- **library**: search the library first (GET /v1/god/defs?q=duck); define only what is missing; prefer params and presets over new kinds
