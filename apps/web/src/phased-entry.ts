// P7b lever E1 (team/lanes/t4-p7.md "P7b design"): index.html loads a world page in two phases where that helps. On a
// phone's link every byte waits for the bytes before it, and the world could not start building until the last of ~1 MB
// had arrived (all of React, the Shell, the UI). Phase one is the early entry (early-entry.ts) with only the chunks the
// world's entity layer needs, beside the snapshot the head script already asked for; the layer then builds the terrain
// and the near ring while phase two (main.tsx, React, the Shell, the rest of the UI, the socket) downloads. Phase two
// starts when the snapshot is in (early-entry.ts calls window.__simPhase2), after at most PHASE2_FALLBACK_MS, or at once
// if the early entry fails to load; its socket opens after at most SOCKET_FALLBACK_MS (PF2). P7d: `__simPhase2(true)` starts only its downloads and the socket; the main entry
// itself runs at the next call (early-entry.ts: once the early renderer's poster is up), so it never competes with it. Pages that are not two-phase (the head script's phasedEntryWanted: desktops, old
// worlds, pictures, ?phased=0) load both at once, main first, as before.
// No imports: vite.config.ts loads this file in node.

// and the join (~165 KB) shared the link with the poster's scripts and phase two's entry. And the socket opens once
// phase two's entry has downloaded (not with its download): the join no longer delays the entry, so the card (which
// waits for the entry, not for the join) comes ~1 s sooner. Phase two's entry downloads once its other downloads are in
// and the poster's nearest models are in (the arrival gate), not at the early renderer's fill: on Eden 2026 the gate is
// clear seconds before the fill (the phone is building the world, the link idle). Without the gate check it took the link
// from Mars College's near models (poster +23%).
