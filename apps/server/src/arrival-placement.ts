// arrival-search/1 (lane ARR, 2026-10-20): where a new Soul is born when the world's arrival point cannot take it.
//
// The default placement (the native placer's rings round the arrival point) is kept exactly wherever it works: a ready
// probe whose spot lies in the world's open walkable area is returned untouched, so births in ordinary worlds are
// bit-identical. Otherwise (built over, under water, walled in, crowded) the engine's arrival search names the nearest
// standing spot in the open area out to the world's bounds, else the nearest spot of the largest pocket; the birth then
// carries it as the existing birth-near/1 hint {at, first:true}, so the event records the exact place and replay never
// searches. Refused (birth.arrival-unavailable) only when the world has no standing ground at all.
