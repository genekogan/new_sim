// stall-guard/1 — no Soul's body stays held by an activity that has stopped making progress (Gene's review 2026-10-23, #19:
// Mickey stayed "riding" after the balloon landed, every request failed actor.busy; "this needs to be prevented").
//
// Every second the guard reads each Soul body's hold (engine stallProbeV1, packages/engine-mars/src/stall.ts). A hold that
// should end by itself (a claim or marker left by an action that is gone, a deferred stop, a transfer phase such as boarding,
// stepping out, standing up) and whose signature (pose, holders, phases) has not changed is a stall:
//   (a) after LIMIT_S (default 30, per-activity override in LIMIT_BY_VERB) the world ends it: a logged 'edge-stop'
//       {stallReleaseV1} (replay is exact) frees the body and stands it at the nearest free spot; the owner gets a
//       `stall:released` receipt (code stall.released, detail.stallV1) in the day timeline;
//   (b) the owner wins: a request waiting for the stalled body releases it after OWNER_S, and stand:here releases at once;
//   (c) the guard holds no durable state: after a restore it re-arms from the restored world, so a held body is released
//       LIMIT_S after boot at the latest.
// Never released: a body in a carrier that is aloft, construction work (the engine's own safety owns those), steady holds
// (sitting, lying, riding while flying).
