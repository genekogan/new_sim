// Lane BS1 (BUILDSAFE item 5, 2026-10-21): can a body actually use what a god placed? Every seat is sat on and every berth
// lain on exactly as the sit plan does it (engine useCheckV1: standing approach, the sit/stand slide, joined to the main
// ground both ways, and the seat height for the standard body), and each unusable slot gets one line a god can act on.
// Callers: BS2's commit check (the entities a commit placed or moved) and BS3's fuzz fixture; seatTopsOf also feeds the
// edge sit capability's seat.too-high block (engine-bridge.ts). The walk audit does not call it
// (its V3-walk baseline counts only navTargetsV1).
