// G1 "god rules" (Gene, 2026-10-15): a god edit is never refused or delayed because a resident is in, on, asleep in or
// holding what it changes. Before the edit applies, each resident in its way stands up or wakes, sets down what it
// holds, and walks to the nearest clear standing point outside the affected footprint (outside the building for a
// building edit). The exit is checked against the engine's own walking route planner from where the resident would
// stand up and with the same landing check the fold applies; only a resident with no walking route out is relocated.
// Planning here is pure: the bridge logs the moves (`edge-god-walkout`, `edge-relocate` with `godWalkout` when there is
// no route, `edge-stop` for a resident only heading to a changed seat), folds them before the new geometry reaches the
// engine, and gives each resident its reason (notices.ts).
//
// What counts as "in the way": a thing the edit removes, adds, moves or physically re-makes (its solids, floors,
// stairs, slots, landform or water change; a state-only edit such as a door shut, or a cosmetic param such as a wall
// colour, changes nothing anyone stands in), and anything under it; a resident is in the way when it uses one of those
// things (seat, bed, item in hand), stands inside the new solid/floor footprint of one or the old footprint of
// something it could be in or on (the whole box of a building, interior included; a floor or deck), or when the ground
// under it rises over it, drops away by more than a step, or turns to deep water. A resident still walking to a seat
// the edit changes only stops (its body stays). Held things are set down at the resident's feet, or beside its exit
// when its feet are inside what the edit touches; the exit is never inside a footprint the edit touches. An upstairs
// resident whose floor the edit leaves standing (only its chair moved) steps aside on that floor.
