// Soul navigation to god-built named things (party lane P4). On an entity world a Soul can walk to anything the god
// built and named, by its path: `walk:fountain`, `walk:rose-house` (in at its front door), `walk:rose-house/living`
// (that room's floor), `walk:plaza/bench-2` (the bench's front). Each resolves to a standing point the engine can plan
// to: inside a building's open front door (outside it when the door is closed), a room's floor, the approach to a seat,
// a fountain's rim, the nearest shore of a pond.
//
// World-engine side only: the engine bridge offers these as ordinary `walk:<path>` capabilities through the ledger's
// existing world-profile hook (as the ground host offers `walk:flag-<name>`), labelled with what each thing is and what
// it is by, so the ledger's own vocabulary resolves plain words ("walk to the fountain", "go into rose-house",
// "sit on the bench by the pond") to them. No edge contract change: no new verbs, fields or routes.
//
// Pure reads over the entity model and the engine's standing grids; nothing here is logged or changes the world.
