// G2 (tranche 2026-10-19): the CLI's world mirror as deltas.
//
// The CLI keeps a mirror: the god snapshot plus the layout rows (query `layout`). It used to refetch both after
// every edit and whenever the seq moved: ~320 KB gzip per edit in a small world, 1.6 MB of it the library.
// Here the server remembers, for the last few mirror states it handed out, a hash per layout row and per snapshot
// entity, and answers "what changed since the state with this guard hash" with only the changed rows/entities, the
// ids that went, the small top-level fields, the in-use defs only when they changed, and the library only when the
// client's library hash differs. The guard hash (over every id and row/entity hash, in order) lets the client check
// its patched mirror against the server's and refresh in full on any mismatch. The diff is by content, so
// neighbours that an edit touched (slot use, a parent's children) come along without knowing why they changed.
//
// Rows and entity hashes are cached (G2 row cache, follow-up): an act at Eden 2026 size (4,900 entities) used to lay out
// and hash every row again (~80 ms). A row is reused while everything it reads is unchanged (see `layoutRow` in
// query.ts); the check per entity is a few identity comparisons, so an act's delta costs what changed, not the world.
// Model entities are replaced, never changed in place, by every edit (compile.ts), so an entity's own inputs are its
// object identity.
//
// G3: the ground recipe (45 of 47 KB per act at Eden 2026 size) goes by hash, like the library: every answer names
// `groundHash`; a client that sends the same hash (`ground`) gets `top.ground: null` and `groundRef: true` and keeps its
// copy. Clients that send no hash (CLIs before G3) get the recipe as before.
