// Doors and gates in the walk graph (harvest fix "doorblock", 2026-10-18).

// A def with the `opening` component (core/door@1, core/gate@1, a god's own door or gate) is a door: shut, it blocks
// the gap it stands in; open, it lets walkers through. A def that bakes its own doorway (a footprint portal, a
// building's door) is blocked across that doorway; one that bakes none (a free-standing kit door in its frame) is
// blocked across its own width at its own spot. A wall or fence gate (`gates` param) with a door standing in it yields
// to that door: the door, not the wall's built-in gate, decides whether the gap passes.
