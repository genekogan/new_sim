# Sim

Sim is the server and web app behind **[sim.eden.art](https://sim.eden.art)**: persistent 3D worlds that keep running
whether or not anyone is watching.

- **Souls** are the people of a world. Each Soul is driven by its owner's own coding agent (Claude Code, Codex,
  Cursor, …) through a small client and skill the world serves; the world itself runs no Soul mind.
- **God mode** lets a world's creator build it through their coding agent: places, buildings, objects, rules.
  Each world has exactly one god.
- **Visitors** watch any world live in the browser, on desktop or phone.
- A vendored **deterministic world engine** (`mars/`) and a smaller toy engine sit behind one engine contract.

## Quick start

Requirements: Node ≥ 22.18 and pnpm 10.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/genekogan/new_sim.git sim && cd sim
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm assets:pull                      # media (models, textures, audio) from assets.eden.art, hash-checked
cp .env.example .env
pnpm --filter @sim/web build
BRAIN_MODE=fake DEV_AUTH=1 DATA_DIR=.local/dev node --env-file=.env apps/server/src/main.ts
```

Open <http://localhost:4500/?dev=1> and sign in with any name (`admin` is an admin). `BRAIN_MODE=fake` makes no model
calls and needs no keys. For hot reload, run `pnpm dev` instead of the last two lines (Vite on :5173, proxying to the
server on :4500). More in [docs/development.md](docs/development.md).
