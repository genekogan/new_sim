# Tranche progress log

Running log for the overnight simulation-engine tranche. Newest entries at the bottom.
Budget: weekly usage meter (`<usage-tool>`) started at 11% used; hard stop ≈61%.

## 2026-09-27 ~01:00 — Phase 0 started
- Local git baseline committed (repo root = campus-2026-reconstruction/).
- Spec copied to docs/engineering/SPEC.md; owner decisions in OWNER_DECISIONS.md.
- Running in parallel: AUDIT.md (architecture audit), RESEARCH.md (engine patterns), LIB_EVAL.md (recast/rapier/bvh/bespoke experiments in viewer/experiments/nav-eval).
- Known: `npm test` broken on Node 26 (`--experimental-transform-types` removed) — fix in Phase 1.

## Next steps
1. Integrate audit/research/lib-eval into ENGINEERING.md (assessment + plan + milestones).
2. Phase 1: pure-TS deterministic engine core (`viewer/engine/`): world state, IDs/semantics, action registry + lifecycle, diagnostics, fixed-step runtime, checkpoints.
