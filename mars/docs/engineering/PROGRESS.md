# Tranche progress log

Running log for the overnight simulation-engine tranche. Newest entries at the bottom.
Budget: weekly usage meter (`<usage-tool>`) started at 11% used; hard stop ≈61%.

## 2026-09-27 ~01:00 — Phase 0 started
- Local git baseline committed (repo root = campus-2026-reconstruction/).
- Spec copied to docs/engineering/SPEC.md; owner decisions in OWNER_DECISIONS.md.
- Running in parallel: AUDIT.md (architecture audit), RESEARCH.md (engine patterns), LIB_EVAL.md (recast/rapier/bvh/bespoke experiments in viewer/experiments/nav-eval).
- Known: `npm test` broken on Node 26 (`--experimental-transform-types` removed) — fix in Phase 1.

## Next steps
1. Integrate audit/research/lib-eval into ENGINEERING.md (assessment + plan + milestones).
2. Phase 1: pure-TS deterministic engine core (`viewer/engine/`): world state, IDs/semantics, action registry + lifecycle, diagnostics, fixed-step runtime, checkpoints.

## ~03:00 — Phase 1–2 progress
- AUDIT.md done (key: 2026 GLB has 667 CAD rack_member pieces, no frames; stock library frames 8/12/16/19 ft; no 9 ft part; nav was 1 m grid A* zig-zag, no levels; control plane analytic paths + virtual clock; historical IDs build-order dependent).
- e2e harness done (viewer/e2e, 11/11 green, 17 baselines incl. 2021/2022/2024 correction views; `npm run e2e`). Perf: 2026 = 1083 draw calls / 957k tris.
- Engine: core (hash/rng/history/runtime) + grid nav (EDT, multi-level A*, stair links) + walk_to (traffic yielding, replans) + invariants. `npm run test:engine`: 23/23.
- Research + lib-eval agents still running (repeated network stalls; resumed).

## Next steps
1. Crew carry: SE(2) formation planner + carry action (grips, whole-load clearance), carry regressions 6–7.
2. Takes: recorder + replay + camera independence; sequences/plans bound to baselines; rehearsal API.
3. Assembly: upright raise/hold/beam connect/release predicate.
4. Browser integration: render engine world in studio (debug overlays), then DO integration.

## ~09:30 — Milestones B–G reached on synthetic scenes; campus bridge landed
- Carry (SE(2) hybrid-A*, formations, whole-load clearance), takes/plans/rehearsal/execute, camera (decollide/deocclude/plan), progressive decks + stairs, DO + 9 `engine_*` MCP tools, 2026 campus SpatialScene (7578 prisms, staging-east) — all committed with tests + docs (CARRY.md, TAKES_AND_PLANS.md, CAMERA.md, PROGRESSIVE.md, CAMPUS_SCENE.md).
- Flagship `scenarios/build-bay.ts`: piles → carries → raise/hold → beams → release (refused early) → joists → plywood → stair + treads → visitor walks onto the deck. 43 steps, 456 s sim, 0 violations; execute == rehearsal hash; canonical untouched. Test: `engine/test/build-bay.test.ts`.
- Engine fixes found by the scenario: carry replans on topology change; people in a formation's path halt it and idle bystanders are asked to make way; set-down stations must be clear; raise picks its footing end; walk turn hysteresis, hard separation, continuous stair traversal, stair occupancy waits.
- Stress-30 (lab): 0 violations / 60 s. Lab e2e 13/13 (two spurious ENOENTs from overlapping Playwright runs).
- Env/lighting agent still running (repeated network stalls).

## Next steps
1. Flagship on the real 2026 fork at `staging-east` (crop scene); record take + camera track; capture screenshots via lab/studio.
2. Add `/lab` to Worker SPA routes; full e2e; production deploy with rollback note.
3. Handoff report (HANDOFF.md).

## ~11:30 — Campus flagship green; Gene back online; leadership mode
- Flagship runs on the real 2026 campus fork (staging-east): 43 steps, 548 s sim, 0 violations, execute == rehearsal (engine/test/campus-flagship.test.ts).
- Env track done: real NOAA sun, wetness, cloud-softened shadows; studio baselines refreshed.
- Gene's instruction: Fable leads/evaluates, Opus subagents do narrow work. Delegated: (1) progressive deck-y regression + nav perf caching, (2) Lab build-bay scenario + captures, (3) HANDOFF.md draft.
- Pending after (1): full-suite green → production deploy with rollback note.

## ~15:00 — Review fixes, perf, lab flagship, release prep
- Independent review (REVIEW.md): 3 critical / 2 high reproduced (carrier teleport on flipped replan; holders could walk away; walkers through carried loads; failed actions leaked reservations/tasks/traffic; snapped goals). All fixed with regression tests (engine/test/review.test.ts) + new invariants: motion.teleport (0.6 m/tick), support.holder-missing, collision.human-load. Engine suite 126 pass / 1 skip.
- Deck-y "regression" was a fixture bug (frames sunk 3.8 cm); beam height is now correctly seat-relative. Perf: cached base rasters — campus flagship compute 56 s → 17 s, hashes identical.
- Lab: flagship runs live in /lab via SequenceRunner.advance/poll; final hash == Node rehearsal. Baselines: build-bay-held-oblique.png, build-bay-visitor-oblique.png (reviewed by lead).
- Release prep: prepare.py allowlist fix for /engine (would have 404'd in prod); dry run + local smoke + MCP integration pass; rollback target de2dddaa-0fab-477c-8b8f-cb1c579efba5 (deployment.json was stale).
- Open (documented): raise crew stands at the base only; lifts not swept; beam spins 180° during connect (one-liner in beam.ts); carrier can bump a walker stopped beside the path (1/51 layouts); no lifting poses.
- Deploy agent running: gates → e2e → build → deploy → live smoke → docs.

## ~17:30 — Post-deploy
- Production live: d33a4d6b (from 2ecff4b); rollback de2dddaa. HANDOFF.md finalized. Beam 180° spin fixed (42abb2a; changes flagship hash — prod is 2 commits behind, cosmetic). Doc numbers refreshed (a2336a3).
- Continuing one agent at a time (Gene: max 3, quota-conscious): review mediums M1/M2/M4 in progress. Next candidates: raise choreography (crew at the rising end) + swept lifts; gate script; planning budget.

## ~20:00 — Review mediums, raise choreography, swept lifts, determinism hole
- M1/M2/M4 fixed (cf86834, 1c70f65, 3c0263b); runner timeout now settles deferred cancels; execute refuses unsettled commits.
- raise_upright: lifters walk the far end up (≤0.6 m/s, hands ≤1.9 m), footers at the base, per-tick clearance + blocked diagnostics (bc0cf8f). Swept lifts + lift-over fallback for beam/joist/plywood/tread (ace7fa1); symmetric parts no longer spin mid-air. Engine 136/137.
- Lab baselines refreshed + new build-bay-raise-oblique (893b0ba); lead inspected raiseA-45deg: plausible; caveats: footer's arms hang until the column is in reach; deck_s1 lift-over reads as a floating sheet (crew 2.9 m away) — TODO crew accompanies lifted parts.
- FOUND: browser≠node final hash since ace7fa1 — Math.sin/cos/atan2 differ in the last bit between Chromium 153 and Node 26 (spec §23 warning realised). Fix in progress: deterministic trig in core/math.ts, grep guard, golden bit patterns, determinism-probe.mjs.
- Production still d33a4d6b (behind: beam spin, review fixes, raise/lift work). Redeploy after the determinism fix lands and e2e is green.

## ~22:00 — Determinism fixed; second production release
- Deterministic trig (fdlibm-style, +−×÷√ only) replaces Math.sin/cos/atan2/atan/exp/log across engine (ec13a19, eccfd43, 6593a06); source-scan test + 37 golden bit patterns; deploy/determinism-probe.mjs. Browser == Node == production hash 5c29efcf… at tick 10918. Engine 141/142.
- Production 6f1200ce (from 6593a06); rollback d33a4d6b. Gates: 48/48, 141/1 skip, tsc clean, e2e 26/26; live MCP PASS; headless prod /lab flagship 43/43, 0 violations.
- In progress: crew accompanies lifted parts (floating-sheet look during lift-over).

## ~23:30 — Paused
- "Crew accompanies lifted parts" (floating-sheet look during lift-over): attempted 4× by a subagent, each attempt stalled on the network before writing anything; nothing landed. DEFERRED — brief is in the next-tranche list (HANDOFF §Suggested next tranche, item 3) and in this entry: crew walks alongside the part (positions from the part pose each tick, ≤0.9 m/s, no clipping); `lift.hands-out-of-reach` invariant (holder within 1.0 m of a hand point, hand points ≤2.4 m above the holder's floor); tests for a joist lift and a plywood lift-over.
- Spawning paused by the lead until the connection is steady; production is current (6f1200ce) and the tree is clean.

## ~01:00 (09-28) — Gate script; retrying lifted-parts
- `npm run gate` (deploy/gate.mjs, 5e077a5): test → test:engine → tsc → e2e → determinism probe (+ simulation-integration when SIM_BASE set); report under viewer/.cloudflare/gate/<ts>/. First real run green (48/48, 141/1 skip, clean, 26/26, hash 5c29efcf…). RELEASE_CHECKLIST now requires a green gate report with matching gitHead and gitDirty:false.
- Network steady again; "crew accompanies lifted parts" retried with reduced scope (plan file committed first).

## 2026-09-27 ~21:15Z: Third production release (crews accompany lifted parts)
- Pre-step `497e913`: `RULES_VERSION` changed to `mars-assembly/2` (plans bound under `/1` now report stale). `campus.test` uses the constant. The stale `holdersPresent` comment is fixed. Engine 144/1 skip, tsc clean.
- The first gate run went red on one e2e baseline only: `build-bay-visitor-oblique` at 2.74 % (crews end in different spots). Reviewed: same end state, nobody inside geometry. Refreshed in `3f5ece7`. Gate rerun GREEN: 48/48, 144/1 skip, clean, 26/26, hash `d54eca7c…f610` (was `5c29efcf…`; 11522 ticks, was 10918, intended). Report `.cloudflare/gate/2026-09-27T21-06-25-559Z`, gitDirty false.
- Production `17f7c9aa-84d1-437d-b1d6-287c85e553fe` (from `3f5ece7`); rollback `6f1200ce…`. Live smoke 200 / R2 200, integration PASS, headless prod `/lab` 43/43, 0 violations. Prod hash matches node.

## ~03:00 (09-28) — Lifted parts, release 3, planning budget
- Crews accompany lifted parts (13b5b4b..b5fc83b): lift.hands-out-of-reach invariant, LIFT_APEX_MAX 2.4 m, lift.crew-blocked; RULES_VERSION mars-assembly/2.
- Production 17f7c9aa (from 3f5ece7), rollback 6f1200ce; gate green (gitDirty:false); prod hash == probe d54eca7c…
- Planning budget (4969f6a..324102e): default A* 2× cheaper with bit-identical routes (stress-30 worst tick 233 → 80–91 ms warm); opt-in corridor planner (42–46 ms, routes differ ≤3.9 %); construction replans staggered ≤4/tick; rt.profile hook; deploy/perf-stress.mjs; all hashes unchanged. Lead loosened the wall-clock test bounds (250/120 ms) to avoid gate flakes.
- Not deployed (engine-internal perf); rides with the next release.

## ~06:00 (09-28) — Three parallel tracks (Gene asked for 3)
- Social vocabulary (engine/social: slots as reservations; sit/stand/face/converse/gather/campfire_circle/ambient_wander; SOCIAL.md).
- Review M3/M5/M6 fixed: people-as-obstacles use foot height; canonical entity order (forward/reverse hash equal); DO stores content-addressed states, rehearse writes 0 B unless keep.
- Evidence report: `npm run evidence` → EVIDENCE.md/evidence.json, all 17 §28 rows + A–H mapped to passing tests with honest approximation notes.
- Campus take in the studio: deploy/record-campus-take.mjs → public/engine/takes/flagship-campus-2026.json (1.41 MB, gzip 206 KB, take id f747d29d…); /studio "Replay take" (banner, scrubber, engine camera toggle, diagnostics); camera shotlist (10 shots, 0 wall crossings, readability min 0.72); e2e/studio-take.spec.ts; gate green (27 e2e). Lead inspected studio-take-held/visitor: correct placement east of Chiba among the trailers; people on the ground; shots readable.
- Running: carrier-vs-stopped-walker + DO caps; evidence gaps (19 ft raise, 2 m passing, U-start). Then deploy 4.
