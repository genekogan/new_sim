# Release checklist: Mars Studio Worker (`mars-campus-2026`)

Prepared 2026-09-27 against HEAD `19aa5b6`, with the `prepare.py` allowlist change committed
alongside this file. **Nothing has been deployed.** This file covers the release build, the
dry run and a local smoke of the built worker. The production deploy is left for Gene to run.

- Worker: `mars-campus-2026` at https://mars-campus-2026.<workers-subdomain>.workers.dev
- R2 bucket: `mars-campus-2026-models`
- Wrangler: 4.136.2 (repo-pinned). Auth uses the existing OAuth login; never read credential files.
- Procedure source: `viewer/deploy/README.md`

## Rollback target (record before deploying)

| Source | Version id |
|---|---|
| `wrangler deployments status` (live, 100%, created 2026-09-26T22:45Z) | **`de2dddaa-0fab-477c-8b8f-cb1c579efba5`** |
| `viewer/deploy/deployment.json` `version` | `763de986-3bdd-4947-a335-226f28a8ed79` (**stale**: 20:20Z deploy, superseded by `11817b82…` and then `de2dddaa…`) |

Roll back to **`de2dddaa-0fab-477c-8b8f-cb1c579efba5`**. After the new deploy, update
`deployment.json` so its `version` field holds the new id.

## Deploy (from `viewer/`)

```sh
# 0. Only if the browser model must be rebuilt (not needed this release; public/browser/campus.glb{,.br} exist, 2026-09-22)
#    python3 deploy/browser-model.py && node deploy/compress-browser.mjs
# 1. Stage the allowlisted public release (.cloudflare/public, .cloudflare/large, manifests)
python3 deploy/prepare.py
# 2. Release build (vite with publicDir=.cloudflare/public, then deploy/configure.mjs → dist/server/)
CLOUDFLARE_RELEASE=1 npm run build
# 3. Large objects → R2. Resumable and content-hash keyed. Currently a no-op (see below).
WRANGLER_WRITE_LOGS=false node deploy/upload.mjs
# 4. Optional last check
WRANGLER_WRITE_LOGS=false ./node_modules/.bin/wrangler deploy --config dist/server/cloudflare.json --dry-run --outdir /tmp/mars-dry
# 5. Deploy
WRANGLER_WRITE_LOGS=false ./node_modules/.bin/wrangler deploy --config dist/server/cloudflare.json
# 6. Post-deploy verification
SITE_BASE=https://mars-campus-2026.<workers-subdomain>.workers.dev ALL_ASSETS=1 node deploy/smoke.mjs
SIM_BASE=https://mars-campus-2026.<workers-subdomain>.workers.dev node deploy/simulation-integration.mjs
WRANGLER_WRITE_LOGS=false ./node_modules/.bin/wrangler deployments status --name mars-campus-2026
```

R2 upload status: after staging, all 8 large objects in `.cloudflare/large-assets.json` are
already recorded in `.cloudflare/uploaded.json`. The large-asset manifest is byte-identical to
the previous release, so `upload.mjs` will skip every object (`Already uploaded`). The objects:
`/browser/campus.glb(.br)`, `/modular/{campus,chiba}-components.glb`,
`/modular/mars-2026-modular.blend`, `/data/campus.{glb,blend}`, `/data/chiba.blend`.

## Rollback

Syntax taken from `wrangler rollback --help` and `wrangler versions deploy --help` (4.136.2):

```sh
cd viewer
WRANGLER_WRITE_LOGS=false ./node_modules/.bin/wrangler rollback de2dddaa-0fab-477c-8b8f-cb1c579efba5 \
  --name mars-campus-2026 -m "rollback: <reason>"
# equivalent, via versions (100% traffic to the prior version):
WRANGLER_WRITE_LOGS=false ./node_modules/.bin/wrangler versions deploy de2dddaa-0fab-477c-8b8f-cb1c579efba5@100 \
  --name mars-campus-2026 -m "rollback: <reason>"
# inspect
./node_modules/.bin/wrangler versions list --name mars-campus-2026
./node_modules/.bin/wrangler deployments list --name mars-campus-2026
```

A rollback restores the Worker code and its static assets. It does not undo Durable Object
storage writes or R2 objects. R2 keys are content-hashed, so the old version's large files are
still present. The new release adds no DO migration: `migrations` still lists only
`simulation-v1`. `engine_blobs` is created lazily by the engine code in the DO. Rolling back
leaves those rows unread; they do no harm.

## Allowlist change in this release

`deploy/prepare.py` previously staged no `engine/` namespace. As a result,
`/engine/campus-2026.json` (the browser fetch URL `CAMPUS_2026_URL` in `engine/campus/load.ts`)
would 404 in production. Added one allowlist line: `'engine': ['campus-2026.json']`. The file
passes through `scrub()` (no `/Users/` or localhost strings are present) and is re-serialized
(982,684 → 1,081,647 B; static asset, under 25 MiB). `/lab` itself only needs
`/modular/environment/animated-*.glb`, which the existing `environment/` rglob already covers.
Release: 304 files, 788.4 MiB staged (8 large → R2).

## Results (2026-09-27, local)

**Build.** `CLOUDFLARE_RELEASE=1 npm run build` exited 0. The only warning is the known
three-resources chunk over 500 kB.
- `dist/client`: 187 MB, 312 files. The largest JS chunk is `three-resources` at 679 kB
  (173 kB gzip).
- Worker: `dist/server/simulation.js` 3.25 MB and `cloudflare-entry.js` 2.8 kB. The bundled
  dry-run output is 3.36 MB (`/tmp/mars-dry/cloudflare-entry.js`).
- `/lab` and `/lab/` appear in the SPA route list in `dist/server/cloudflare-entry.js`,
  alongside `/`, `/studio`, `/studio/202x` and `/simulation-guide`.
- `dist/client/engine/campus-2026.json` is present.

**Dry run.** `wrangler deploy --dry-run --outdir /tmp/mars-dry` exited 0. It read 331 asset
files. Total upload 3285.64 KiB (676.33 KiB gzip). Bindings: `SIMULATIONS`
(DO `MarsSimulation`), `MODELS` (R2 `mars-campus-2026-models`), `ASSETS`.

**Local smoke.** Ran `wrangler dev --config dist/server/cloudflare.json --port 8901`. The
server was stopped afterwards.

`SIM_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:8901 node deploy/simulation-integration.mjs` exited 0 and printed
two PASS lines. The first covers the MCP handshake, 20 legacy tools, 9 engine tools
(bind/rehearse/execute/take/camera), room isolation, read-only access, invalid camera,
idempotency, walking, activities, pause and persisted state. The second covers auth before
body parsing, method limits, prototype keys and body-size limits. Engine timings in DO:
rehearse 269 ms, execute 230 ms, camera 245 ms; take 33,656 B.

**Tests.** `npm test` passed 48/48. `tsc --noEmit -p .` is clean. `npm run test:engine` has
**1 failure that predates this change** at HEAD: `engine/test/progressive.test.ts:100`, test
"progressive floor: after 1 of 2 sheets only the installed sheet is walkable". The assertion
"standing on the deck (y 1.949…)" fails and the failure reproduces in isolation. The MCP
integration run above still passed. Nothing in this commit touches engine code.
Decide whether to fix it before deploying.
