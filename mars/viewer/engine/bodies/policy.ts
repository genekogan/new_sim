// What a floater (a static head: no hands, no arms, no feet, no lap) can do with each Mars verb.
// Every verb in api/registry.ts createRegistry() and every sequence built-in has exactly one entry
// (engine/test/floaters.test.ts enforces this both ways), each with a named reason:
//   works        — the verb's meaning survives intact with a head (face, converse, controls).
//   approximates — the verb runs with the ordinary engine semantics on the ground pose and the head is
//                  drawn hovering there (walk → glide, sit / audience / fire place → hover at the slot,
//                  sleep → settle low over the mat). The approximation is named so a UI can say so.
//   refuses      — the verb needs hands, arms, feet or a seat to ride; it is refused by name, never faked.
// Roles: a composite verb may admit a floater in one role (listener) and refuse it in another (reader).
// A role is a top-level param key; a floater id found under it gets that role's verdict, anywhere else
// the verb's own verdict. Delegating verbs (living_intention, gathering_continuation) judge their bound
// child verbs. A verb with no floater among its params is not this module's business: 'works' (humanoid).
// Pure and deterministic: no Runtime, no registry import (the table is checked against it in tests).
