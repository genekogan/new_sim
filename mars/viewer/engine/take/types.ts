// A Take is what actually happened during one execution (spec §21–23):
// resolved motion + discrete state changes + runtime events + the final state.
// Replay reads only this — never the planner, registry or a Runtime.
// Camera tracks are separate objects that point at a take; they are not part
// of the take body, so attaching/editing them can never change the take hash.

 * /2 (2026-09-28, W10): changes also carry hands (integer mm), baseActivity, on, speed (integer cm/s), contents.
 * /3 (2026-09-28, W20): `hands` and `speed` changes are thinned keyframes (INTERP_FIELDS), linearly interpolated
 * between consecutive keyframes of the same entity (TAKES_AND_PLANS.md "Thinned fields"); every other field is
 * still a step (last value ≤ t). A /2 reader sees the same shapes, but holds each keyframe instead of interpolating.
 * /4 (2026-09-28, W22): `entities0` (every tracked entity as first recorded: def, kind, pose, phase / support, contents …
 * minus provenance / label / tags) and `removed` ([{ id, t }]), so an entity removed before the end (an emptied pile) is
 * drawable; pose tracks simplified at TRACK_TOL (4 mm / 8 mrad instead of 1 / 1; holds exact at both ends); `events` compacted (`compactEvents`):
 * a same-tick requested → validated → reserved → … lifecycle run is one event with `from: 'requested'` (lossless,
 * `expandEvents`), and a repeated blocked wait (same action, code, message) is one event at its first tick with `n` and
 * `until` (its last tick; the resumes in between are dropped). TAKES_AND_PLANS.md "Compact tracks, events and entities0".
